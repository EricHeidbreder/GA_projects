For example, I've been assuming that there are more East Asians than Black people within punk subculture, but only on the basis of anecdotal evidence, not hard data.

I suppose you could run a poll on here, but the data would be skewed by Reddit's demographics."
2720,poppunkers,poppunkers," Hey everyone - I just dropped this new episode of my podcast 'These Five Songs' today. Me and Mike Cunniff from Boston Manor got to talk about the 5 songs that influenced the writing and recording of their new album Glue, releasing tomorrow 05/01. We got to talk about A LOT of things like dropping their guitars and introducing more electronic elements, the creative process of the record, the backlash and polarizing fan reaction to 'Everything is Ordinary', and how 'Glue' likely saved the band from breakup - There's a lot to dive into here, check it out before 'Glue' drops tomorrow 

Enjoy!

I've been curating a cool playlist featuring some essential punk tracks and spin offs of the genre from the 60s to the 80s, as well as some songs that aren't exactly punk rock, but definitely inspired early artists in the genre with their attitude and aesthetics.

Over 8 hours of music with one song per band/artist. Shuffle and enjoy! Would love any recommendation that fits the theme!"
1317,poppunkers,punk,"I'm late to the game, probably. I haven't listened to Strung Out in years, so I've been going through their records again, starting with the first three (kinda stopped paying attention to them after that). I was never a huge fan of this band, other than Twisted By Design, that record was phenomenal. 

So, first impression: the band has aged well. I think I like them more now than I did when I was a kid. 

Second: the remixes of these records. Holy hell. One of the reasons I was never a huge fan of the band was because of how shitty their first records sounded. The songs weren't bad, but those albums have SO MUCH DAMN COMPRESSION on it, they felt like the punk rock version of And Justice for All. Just all tinny and shitty sounding. 

Side note: that's how I feel about a LOT of the Fat Wreck output of the late 90's. So much decent music ruined by overly compressed production. ANYWAY...

The first two records actually sound like real albums now. They're completely listenable. The third one, my favorite...not sure how much I like the remix there, but I think it's just more of a ""I'm used to the old one"" situation. It definitely sounds good. 

I'm seriously blown away by how these records sound. More 90's Fat Wreck bands should remix their early records."
852,punk,punk,"I just watched the jawbreaker documentary on Prime. It's really good and I recommend it. One thing I still don't understand is why the final album wasn't a broader commercial success. I understand that the butthurt East Bay Punk fans didn't like it, but why not the general public at Large? It just sounds like (rather good) 90s alternative. To me it sounds better than a lot of the bands that did achieve commercial success in that genre."
997,punk,punk,"I was born in 2001, and didn't discover classic punk until I was 18, so I really feel like I missed out. I wanted to put a few patches on it of the Germs, Circle jerks, Dead Kennedys and a few other bands that ill never be able to see live, and fill the rest up with bands I see lithe?

The Ramones album sales are surprisingly low. Along with every famous punk act I could think of like The Stooges, Flipper, Black Flag."

2732,poppunkers,poppunkers,"It may be because this is one of the genres I follow most but I notice a lot of band's touring nationally are well known but not super famous.  I've seen a bit of AMA's and interaction from said band members on here so I'm hoping someone active here can give some insight.  

I've seen how some of the bands I've considered to be super famous/main stream don't even come close to 6 figure salaries per member so it's hard to imagine these smaller bands surviving only off their music. 

So do any well known artist wind up touring a few months of the year and working boring jobs the rest of it?"

How's everyone else's listen going? :)"
193,punk,punk,"not looking punk but still being in the punk mindset is the most punk thing you can do. being told what to wear to fit into the subculture isn‚Äôt punk and I think that anyone who does this deserves a

1096,punk,punk,"I‚Äôm pretty sure you guys have heard this comparison before but there‚Äôs a lot of stuff in common apart from just the overall ‚Äúedginess‚Äù of the groups.

1. Both groups had an extremely short run. Each made only one famous studio album and then split up in less than 5 years. 

2. Both were one of the most vulgar, controversial, anti-establishment, and censored groups of their respective eras, and had a reputation of violence and danger.

3. Both the Sex Pistols and NWA have been credited as being one of the original creators or trend setters of their respective genres; Punk Rock and Gangsta Rap, respectively.

4. Both groups consisted of a star member who actually wasn‚Äôt particularly a ‚Äòmusician‚Äô as such, but had the right look and lifestyle that embodied the ethos and culture of their respective genres. (Sid Vicious and Eazy-E)

5.  Both these icons lead relatively dangerous and ‚Äòhardcore‚Äô lives and then ultimately died due to their destructive lifestyles, shortly after the break up of the group. (Eazy-E dies of AIDS and Sid Vicious dies of heroin overdose).

6. Both the Sex Pistols and NWA have had the police invade their shows in the middle of their live performances. (The Pistols during the Jubilee boat trip in 1977 and NWA during their Detroit performance in 1989)

7. Both groups represented highly economically disadvantaged and working class communities.

8. The most controversial song of both, was a highly anti-establishment track directed at a particular figure of authority (the Queen of England and the police). Both songs were then banned from the radio.

9. Managers of both groups were said to be middle class money-hungry men, who cheated the members out of their money and were responsible for the ultimate split of the band/group."

 My Chemical *Romance‚Äôs* North American tour went on sale this past Friday, sending emo kids into a frenzy. The entire tour reportedly sold out in record time, selling 228,600 tickets in under six hours.

Florida Pop-Punk/Power-Pop band [Arrows in Action](https://open.spotify.com/artist/467o5z7PYxbXFAGA0mvhAQ?si=OIDb2PjzTQamp0IFkII5Pg) recently announced their Spring tour with Utah based Pop Rock/Pop-Punk band [Roseburg](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6aYFM3YVoyI9q7DuTRY9nY?si=S883cY2LRT-IQpojQZYdsg) starting in April of 2020.

3337,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Title says it all. Mayday Parade is one of my favorite bands but I can‚Äôt find anyone willing to go with me since the cities near me (Louisville and Cincinnati) have dates that are the weekend before finals at my school. I‚Äôm nervous about the idea of going alone, so I was wondering if anyone else is planning to go and would be interested in meeting up?

I‚Äôm a 20 year old female willing to go with anyone from 18-30. 

Dates are May 1 for Louisville and May 2 for Cincinnati. I‚Äôm open to either one."
1172,punk,punk," So I was in a UNIQLO shop in China and I heard this song. I think its genre is Punk rock, or more maybe Emo Punk.

The last three lines of its lyrics are:

**Just walk away from it all**

**walk away from it all**

**walk away from it all** (the ""all"" is somewhat prolonged)

I wonder if anyone knows this song and could kindly tell me its title. Thank you! :)"
119,punk,punk,"Just found out that a musician that I like to listen to has done some pretty fucked up shit. 

I‚Äôm kind of at a moral crossroads - stop listening to his music because of what he‚Äôs done, or think of his music separate from him and still enjoy listening. I mean, would that be bad, morally, to keep listening? Should the music be separated from the shitty musician who made it?"

2016,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Doesn‚Äôt have to be 100% strictly pop punk (but still has to be in this scene at least)

What bands (like 3-5) do you think are best bands right now / the bands who are gonna be carrying this scene and at the top within the next like 3 or so years?"
898,punk,punk,"Did you go to a protest? Did you write a song? Did you create something? Give someone a hug that needed it? Did you call someone out on their bullshit? Did you riot? Did you help someone that needed it?

The point is...make sure you do something. I can't tell you what to do, but it's not ok to sit back and watch this all happen and not participate. That's endorsing this vile behavior from the cops, and that's not very punk at all.

Love you all, stay safe, but most importantly, get involved."
1619,punk,punk,"I remember, not so fondly, during the Bush administration here in the US, that bands everywhere were churning out music regarding what was going on domestically and abroad. 

Given how things are now; Trump, Brexit, COVID-19, the list goes on, it seems like there is a serious lack of new music to help us process all of it. If any of you out there know of some bands/artists that are encapsulating what is going on send it my way PLEASE!"

Real Friends- Maybe This Place is the Same and We‚Äôre Just Changing

Tiny Moving Parts- This Couch is Long and Full of Friendship

La Dispute- Rooms of the House

Always thought it was funny that looking at one of these always made me think of the other two, what are your guy‚Äôs favorites?

My personal favorite is TMP, that whole album slaps man it just oozes energy, their best very closely after Pleasant Living.

Rooms of the House is awesome, Woman(in mirror) is one of my favorites by them but imo Wildlife and Somewhere at the Bottom of the River between Vega and Altair are much stronger albums.

Real Friends is mostly nostalgic because Summer was one of my first favorite pop punk songs."

Take a ride on the wild side with a figment of your imagination. This music video is a masterpiece of the power of the mind, as our main character falls manically in love with an impossibly perfect large bearcat, of whom she is the sole beholder. The punk-esque song has both chaos and harmony, and the lyrics can be taken to mean many things depending whose meaning is applied. This a well constructed masterpiece, and miles above any other music video released this month.

Life is about making decisions. This song is about moving past the bad ones so we can make better ones. The sound is a rare mix of melodic and rough vocals set to punchy rock that works perfectly with message of the song. Tired Radio is releasing their debut album this week, and we are looking forward to hearing more!

The soft sound of Brazilian Portuguese is the perfect ride-along for the smooth voices and sparse instruments that are Sessa.

The female vocal harmony relaxes the mind and solidifies this distinctly Brazilian sound. From the first short interview segment we can see how the appreciation of letting life happen instead of trying to control it leads to music like this.

The most unexpected treasure I found in our journey through Brazil was the crazy amount of incredible music and musicians that seemed in a bubble, cut off from the rest of the world‚Äôs ears. I‚Äôm happy to see KEXP putting Brazillian music in the spotlight, where it belongs.

# Album

## [Sunset in the Deep End by Yppah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBDCFu3W74)

üìç Long Beach, California, USA  
*See this track on our* [*music map üó∫Ô∏è*](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=33.732&amp;locLng=-118.063&amp;zoom=12&amp;id=1790)

This album falls into the uncategorizable category of sonic masterpieces that seem to abstract out the experience of experience itself. The mix of vocals, sweeping strings, slow synths, and unnamable sounds is certain to bring tingles of endorphins everywhere the nerves reach. This album seems to be over as soon as you put it on, as you regain consciousness and forget you ever left.

We talked about how quickly the [Neck Deep situation](https://old.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/3i08d6/a_few_of_neck_deeps_members_are_being_accused_of/?sort=old) was resolved but how all over the place it was. Especially since [this AP](https://www.altpress.com/news/neck_deep_respond_to_allegations/) article made it seem like the allegations were based off the tumblr posts

- Do/did you believe that Lloyd was guilty based off of the evidence
- Did you think the band handled the allegations well

1176,punk,punk,"Apologies for the awful formatting, I'm on mobile.

The Satanic Temple is currently the only Satanist ""religion"" officially recognized by the US Government that is still considered active, it's tenets are as follows:

One should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason.

The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.
One‚Äôs body is inviolable, subject to one‚Äôs own will alone.

The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend.
To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.

Beliefs should conform to our best scientific understanding of the world. We should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit our beliefs.
People are fallible. If we make a mistake, we should do our best to rectify it and remediate any harm that may have been caused.

Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought.
The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.


This isn't an attempt to convert anyone at all, we're punks, we do whatever the fuck we want, it's our nature, I'm just pointing out that Satanism, to use the symbolism of a band named ""ghost"", is taking the lantern at your feet that god gives you, throwing it away, and finding your own path, which is a CARDINAL sin in christianity, but a fundamental part of Satanism, and both the church and temple, as different as they be, use Satan not as a deity, but as a symbol of the Eternal Rebel in all of us, which is the whole point of being a punk.

From the interactions I've had with followers of the Temple so far, they are absolutely wonderful people, and will probably help the world more than Christianity has, in my opinion.

Just some food for (free) thought, hail Satan

1065,punk,punk,"Hi everyone, I know most people need a new podcast like they need another hole in their heads, but I also know we all have a lot more time on our hands, so I figured I should share a new thing my friend and I are doing, called **The Dischourse.** The idea is simple: we're listening to every single release (and a lot of half releases) on Dischord Records.  We've got history, opinions, and a way to see why one of the greatest punk and all-around labels of all time means so much.

[The Dischourse](https://anchor.fm/thedischourse)

We're two people who grew up in DC in the early 00s right in the shadow of Fugazi going on hiatus, and so it's always been a big part of our lives. We just released our 8th episode, covering basically right up until Fugazi, so about 45 releases so far. Ian MacKaye actually gave us his blessing:

Songs like ""Emergency"", ""Pressure"", or ""All We Know"", which I feel are better written than MisBus, could've been the one to do it.

I think Tom and Andrew have been writers and producers for almost all of ADTR‚Äôs catalog and I‚Äôm sure other projects too. So aside from Neck Deep losing Lloyd and eventually Fil, I feel like Jeremy, Tom, and Andrew had an even bigger impact on why this album is so great.

331,punk,punk,"I'm going to start with saying I aknowledge that punk is not a fashion show, it's an attitude first and a music genre second. Same more or less applies to gender presentation, save for being a music genre. This in mind, I need to figure out a masculine punk-style hat.

(this is the TL;DR of the post, the rest is just an anecdote about my personal life)

 Yesterday, I drove my boyfriend an hour away to his hometown to spend the night. It was a cool day, so I grabbed my studded jacket, a somewhat-vulgar t-shirt, camo pants and studded combat boots. The next day, it was hot, so when we went shopping for groceries, I left the coat at home and due to my can't-handle-the-daystar, nocturnal albino ass, I needed something to shield my head and my eyes from the sun, so I slapped on a random old baseball cap.

 At the store my boyfriend remarked I look like the hillbilly guy in Left4Dead.

 Like I know punk's not a fashion show, and nothing wrong with a respectable redneck, but that is *really* not the aesthetic I'm going for.

 In conclusion, I have no idea how to even start looking, but I need a hat that would give some protection from the elements and also fit with a punk style."

2907,poppunkers,poppunkers,"During these weird times where we‚Äôre all most likely stuck inside of our houses, what could be better than reminiscing back to when we were actually allowed outside, but more importantly thinking back to the best shows we‚Äôve been to. So the question is just that what has been everyone‚Äôs favorite/craziest concert you have all been to?
For me it‚Äôs down to 2! The first one is when I saw Fall Out Boy in 2016 during WINTOUR when they sold out MSG because of just how much I loved the set list, but also because it was my first time ever seeing them live! 
The second however is when I somehow got tickets to see All Time Low this past December for their Nothing Personal 10 year anniversary show at the Starland Ballroom. This is not only because I got to see my current favorite band perform my favorite album by them front to back, but also because it was by far the most hectic but most memorable crowd/pit I have ever been in to date (there were even points where we almost all collapsed).
I can‚Äôt wait to hear what everyone has to say!"
3365,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Many are happy this genre is primarily underground and not generally popular.  But I argue this is still a bad thing. And in particular, with regard to dating and social life.  

Imo, all party venues suck because the music they play sucks.  If there were mainstream pop punk, then parties and raves would play pop-punk and thus would be infinitely more fun. Them not doing so negatively affects my sex life because I do not attend music festivals where party girls want to go due to mainstream music preferences.  ü§¨

They had dual singers (not screamers), two singers. I think one of the songs had the word June or Juno? In it... I can‚Äôt remember the name of the band... I also remember them being somewhere between, or around, Just Surrender and Houston Calls on my old iTunes. Alphabetically order in artists... I can‚Äôt remember any more than that....

1243,punk,punk,"Hi everyone, I‚Äòm fairly new here but the reason I wanted to discuss it on this subreddit is to get to know different opinions of people whose beliefs in politics and such might be similar to mine!

I live in Germany and schools have been closed for about 5 weeks now but mine will reopen in about a week and a half. 
Most of us (the students) are fed up with this decision for multiple reasons. I guess some simply don‚Äòt wanna go back to school but I personally think the main problem is that the chance to get infected will be incredibly high. If one of us actually catches the virus, there‚Äòs no way the entire school will be a safe place anymore.

Some parents and teachers belong to the group most at risk and even if we‚Äòre all fairly young and might not even show any symptoms, we don‚Äòt want to worsen their/someone else‚Äôs health by infecting them unintentionally.

What makes me really mad is that we haven‚Äòt even really tried online schooling yet with video conferences and such things. We only got assignments we occasionally had to send back to our teachers so I would‚Äòve thought we could try to improve that before we see each other in person again in school. I‚Äôm not even sure wether we‚Äòll have to wear masks or anything 'cause if we don‚Äòt have to, I‚Äòm pretty sure some kids won‚Äòt do it.

So what do you all think about this? Until now I could only form my opinion based on my feelings and experiences but I‚Äòd really really like to hear the opinions of people that aren‚Äòt in my position (for example if you don‚Äòt go to school anymore). I‚Äòm also sure there‚Äòs a political or economical aspect to all of this but I‚Äòd like to educate myself on that matter before speaking up about it so feel free to comment something, I‚Äòm sure it‚Äòll be helpful for me!

Thank you, please stay safe &amp; healthy."

2301,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I've seen more than ever that a lot of popular artists have shown a lot of pop punk influence in their music. 

Artists like Machine Gun Kelly, Yungblud, Halsey, Billie Eilish, Lil Peep, a lot of rising emo rappers and even 5 Seconds of Summer in the early 2010's have cited pop punk bands as big influences in their music. Like Finn McKenty of the Punk Rock MBA said, If these artists were around in the early 2000's, they would've been the ones starting pop punk bands.

And now singer, rapper and memer Oliver Tree is working on a pop punk influenced song with Travis Barker. 

Travis seems to be the go-to guy to work with if you want to do a pop punk-type song.

What other artists have shown their pop punk influenced? And what could the future of pop punk in popular music be?"

I know miss Rona is limiting stuff, but for months before this, I've been dying to get into the pit and actually experience a show for myself.

It's not that there's a nonexistent scene in my city. It's just that they're all 19+ (I live in New Brunswick, Canada).  When I try researching, all I can find is lists of seemingly dreamy all ages scenes that went down years ago. I even tried looking in neighbouring cities, it seems like there's nothing at all that's available to me. I'm not above sneaking into places, but I need to know how to do that before I go in guns blazing. I'm not even trying to get my hands on alcohol. 

When this all ends, does anyone have any tips on how to find underground venues that people my age can get into? I feel like a fake punk for never having experienced a show. Any tips would be really appreciated."

I recently got Spotify premium and went back to check out some early GC on a whim. They previously lost me with the release of Good Mourning Revival and I haven‚Äôt kept up with them for years. After listening to some old favorites, I decided to give some of their newer music a try. 

I gave Youth Authority a spin and man I am so bummed that I slept on this album for so long. The Outfield is easily a top 3 song of all time for them. Makeshift Love, Life Changes, and Keep Swingin‚Äô are all great songs. Hell, even 40 Oz.

42,punk,punk,"I‚Äôve been thinking about it for a while since I‚Äôve seen the same genres of punk get rehashed and revived quite a bit through the 2010s to less and less success outside of the scene so I tried to brainstorm an idea for punk that truly embodies what punk (at least to me) means and helps move the genre forward.

For one Punk is almost always very left leaning in it‚Äôs messaging, but I don‚Äôt think punk that‚Äôs been in the left-leaning headspace has been really challenging themselves as aggressively to write about extremely leftist topics, so I imagine this punk exercise to be left wing in the vein of bands like IDLES or Parquet Courts, maybe a bit of Against Me!, covering more challenging leftist topics about gender roles, masculinity, capitalism, the failings of neoliberalism, and intersectional socialism. It should be extremely intersectional as well, consistently attempting to outreach to non-punk artists in different genres (like Rap artists who embody punk-ideology) or even different mediums (solidarity with leftist activists, local businesses, independent film-makers).

For the sound, I noticed in the 2010s with the 80s revival, rise of Bedroom-pop, rise of Trap, and commercialization of Indie-Rock what tends to rope in the most listeners is something highly anthemic yet rhythmic and highly-danceable. It isn‚Äôt the 70s, and while story-focused lyricism can be done, the lyricism has to be immediately relatable yet anthemic, think Spanish Love Songs, Off With Their Heads, Kill Lincoln, or the Menzingers.

As far as how it would sound? I think it needs to take on the elements that kept punk kicking through the 2010s with bands like Modern Baseball, Remo Drive, The Wonder Years, IDLES, and Code Orange. That high-impact anthemic-nature, that can sometimes veer off and experiment with different genres.

I think incorporating a Heartland-Dance-Punk type of feel with nods to Bedroom Pop and Midwestern Emo could yield results, pulling in the typical punk-farers as well as more rap-inclined listeners who take liking to the extremely tight-grooves and catchy melody lines, sort of how melodic trappers like Roddy Ricch or Travis Scott gain their appeal. I think a band that almost got their was Deaf Havana with their song ‚ÄúTrigger‚Äù from 2017. Tight dance groove, slamming anthemic Chorus, sad-mosh vibes. On top of this it would definitely not hurt to experiment with Bedroom pop to bring in some Softbois, like how Story So Far pulled in a ton of Starbucks-drinking indie fans with ‚ÄúClairvoyant‚Äù and similar acoustic ballads. I would also add Slam breakdowns to that mix, mainly because Slam Breakdowns fit with the highly-rhythmic style of dance punk and allow for a slight overlap in audience with possible Deathcore, Slamcore, or Metalcore fans.

That‚Äôs my ideas for how punk can push forward into the new decade and renew some of its interest. Any ideas?"
408,punk,punk,"I'm sensing that I'll get lots of hate for this but I don't care. 

Rap is the new punk because of what's been happening for the past 5 years, the whole wave of SoundCloud rappers are some of the most punk people out today, and the alternative rap scene has been flourishing with punk for years. So that's my point I'm trying to make here, Everyone say it with me RAP IS THE NEW PUNK"
2375,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I need help. I have had this unidentifiable pop punk song stuck in my head for years now. If you can think of an app/lyric search engine site/song melody decoder/Shazam type thing I've tried it.

2216,poppunkers,poppunkers,I feel deprived. I saw my last one in February.
1308,punk,punk,"Let me tell you a story. If you care to read. 

I am a 35 year old American white male. Privileged beyond belief and yet, still full of angst. 

When I was 4, I started listening to music. I found an Eddie Money cassette and attached myself to it. Then adopted radio. I grew into Nirvana, Soundgarden etc, whatever was on rock radio in the early 90's. Then, I discovered punk music through a friend. Green Day, then, Propagandhi, NOFX - you know the angsty poppy anti-government shit? I was hooked. Those grinding guitars and fuck it all vocals.  I wanted to be punk because I identified with what they sang about. I mean, I thought I identified because I was a piss and vinegar little spoiled kid.

As life tends to do without control, I became a teenager and had no idea on how the world worked. I watched SLC Punk and thought - yeah, fuck everything. I'm going to be as edgy as I can be. I wore shitty clothes, thrift store plaid golf pants, camouflage fatigues from my dad's military service that I covered in spikes, patches (including an upside down USA flag) and graffiti, liberty spiked and dyed my hair green. Got some attention from high school cretins and teachers concerned about my goals in life. 

I listened to more and more pissed off punk music.  As much as I could, with primitive dial up 90's internet (and no idea what I wanted to download), I would burn CD's of punk music to skateboard with in my privileged parent's big driveway. Nevermind the fact that I even had internet access at all, with parents that could give me whatever I wanted. My family was never really poor, at least, until after I was old enough to know the difference. My father worked his ass off for my sister and I. So, what did I have to be pissed off about?

Well, fast forward several years. I'm in my early 20's, working as a cashier in a grocery store, or stocking retail shelves, I started to notice things weren't the same for my peers. They had all progressed. Married or grabbed themselves some sweet jobs out of college. I wasn't excited about more school so I basically dropped out senior year of high school instead of following my peers into college.

This is when I started some trouble for myself.

See, I was so ""punk"" that I thought it was reasonable to vandalize public institutions. I vandalized churches and schools in the area. (Fuck authority, AMIRITE?!?) Catching burglary charges in the process. Because I wasn't content with fucking up the outside, I had to break shit inside the places too. (Btw, breaking and entering and then vandalizing interiors without theft is still a fucking felony my friends. Duh?)  

Fast forward again, I am out of prison on parole. 2 years of parole. Then 10 years probation. My probation was over in 2015. Contingent on not doing anything stupid of course. (Otherwise I would be imprisoned for the remainder of the parole.) No problem, I laid low, got married and bought a house. I managed to earn a high school diploma before the 21 years old state cut off. Had a few kids between then and now. I work for a construction company estimating costs of projects. I work from home. I listen to music while I work. I am privileged. Probably more so than my peers that went to college 10 years ago. Total poser now for sure. 

Now. 2020. We have a clown car, shit show, presidential administration in America. The country that gave my father his opportunities. The country that paid for my WWII veteran, grandfather's medical bills. He was honored by a serviceman that gave his daughter (my mother) an American flag in memorial at his burial. Which may not mean much to some people but at least it was something. (Is this the same for every person? I don't know.) 

""I'm looking for the crest of a new wave."" 

We are the country that now has a fucking comedian as president. An arrogant and narcissistic shitbag that has to correct himself after every news conference. He has to clarify that he was being sarcastic and trolling the media. And I am pissed off, anxious and full of that teenage angst in my 30's that I never had the chance to savor when I was young and aggressive. I am worried about my babies and my mother, my health impaired brother, my wife's grandparents. Fuck this clown car, shit show.

America used to have some fucking integrity. Or no? My parents told me that our family fought in wars for this country. I should be grateful. As a teenager, I thought not. Fuck America. Fuck authority. Fuck anything that didn't go my way. But they fought against fascism, naziism and other forms. Exactly the fight that I think I am on the right side of. They were the punks that won. Young men in several countries, sent to die but managed to stomp out shitty ideologies.

What is my fucking point? 

My point is. Punk isn't about what ""I"" thought it was. Am I poser? Probably. I didn't fight the good fight.

I broke my ankle in a mosh pit at a Black Label Society concert this past October - Im too old to ""fight the establishment"". So, all you young people. Stand up for what you believe in. Old people are dumb. Misguided. Ignorant. And definitely don't care about you. I don't even care about you. I don't know you, but I'll give you cash if you walk up to me and ask. But I don't think about you. I don't consider all possibilities young people can experience. Fuck you. But be smart and choose the path of least resistance in life. Then you can be aggressively punk. Don't do dumb shit, be smart.

Do I think I am punk. Fuck yeah, I am punk, fuck you. 

TL;DR Make Punk Great Again"

He swears that it's a Rise Against song, despite my skepticism, so posted in their respective subreddit last night. No dice. So, I was redirected here. Hopefully y'all can help because this song search is driving me bonkers seeing as how I usually have a pretty good memory for artists/bands and their corresponding songs. 

All I know about this mystery song is based on my husband's interpretation, so it could get pretty crazy up in here. He says it's a song which talks about traveling across the country and there is a baby in a dumpster. Also note that he and I disputed about it being a Rise Against song (it can't be, especially considering I've searched thru every song of theirs practically) so, I have a feeling that whoever this dumpster baby song is by will be somehow reminiscent of RA. At least it better lol. 

Sorry for the limited amount of info but totally appreciate y'all trying to help solve this. Thanks cats and kittens."

1563,punk,punk,"Wassup dudes, hope you've been doin well all holed up and have been staying safe. 

I've decided to start making some patches again but I was curious how you guys do it and what your preferred technique/method is?

I usually make my patches out of an old t-shirt, I make a stencil out of vinyl and paint the design with some acrylic paint for a couple layers, it works pretty good for me. The only downside is the patch is kinda floppy and after a few years the paint starts to crack a little bit. 

I've seen some people on here talk about screen printing, is the kit worth it? Did you make the kit yourself? Also I've seen a sturdier fabric in some stores that sell punk patches, I'm guessing its black canvas?

Anyway, if anyone could shed some light on some of this I would super appreciate it, thanks!!

579,punk,punk,"Hi, so I have a constant changing music taste and often enjoy political music. Due to trauma I often struggle listening to pure screaming. I have several times gotten confronted (mostly by teen guys) demanding to know what punk music I listen to and then told I listen to ""fake"" or ""normie"" punk music. Or that it's to ""new"" etc etc. Or *gasp* is pop punk/ indie/ rap and I'm such a poser now. 

I have zero fucking clue what counts as punk music. For me punk is an ideology, a thought process. Fighting against oppression, racism and fascists. My grandparents faught against the Nazis when they invaded our country so I am continuing that fight. 

Anyway, ofc not all political music is punk and I'm also not gonna stop enjoying my ""fake"" music cause it's just fucking soundwaves in the air BUT I thought I should check out some music that are punk classics. 

Any recommendations? Any guidelines to know what's ""real"" punk music or not? Can I just enjoy my norwegian political rap music in peace?"

I've found SO MANY new underground pop punk bands that slap lately and the community there is really positive, welcoming, and there are always posts on there about new stuff. It's been a nice community for me to be a part of in addition to this one, so I figured I would bring attention to it in case any of you guys have never heard about it.

The movie we‚Äôre working on is a found footage horror called SHIFTERS:

‚Äú*After getting their tyres slashed for stealing another band‚Äôs songs, a pop punk singer and her band mates are stranded in the middle of nowhere, whilst shapeshifting creatures try to steal their identities.‚Äù*

As the movie is about a British pop punk band, we‚Äôre looking to work alongside a British pop punk artist to either use their previously written songs and/or write some new songs for the actors/band in SHIFTERS to perform. 

We need 5 songs total - most will just need to be performed ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the movie, so won‚Äôt need actual final mixing etc, but 1 track definitely will as we‚Äôre 99% sure we‚Äôll use 1 over the credits. I‚Äôll go into more detail on the music and what we need from it etc at a later date ‚Äì overall we just need cool/catchy/snappy songs for our band to perform.

Basically, right now we‚Äôre starting our search for the right artist(s) to work with, so if you think you‚Äôre a good fit (or know someone who is) and ya want to work with us, please shoot over an email with some of your stuff to [info@badtastepictures.com](mailto:info@badtastepictures.com)

Also, as well as payment (we‚Äôre open to negotiations) you‚Äôll be fully credited at the end of the movie.

If you have any questions I‚Äôll try answer in comments when poss. Thanks!

226,punk,punk,"Hey, gen z punk here!! (16) Ive been thinking, and I‚Äôve noticed some really specific types of alternative kids in my generation, so I‚Äôve made a list here of the types lol: 

1. Eboys/egirls 

Theyre posers, but also extremely popular. At my school in particular I‚Äôve noticed they seem to get a lot of attention, a lot of people love to tell them how unique their style is even though it‚Äôs just a bunch of overpriced clothes they got off of dollskill or hot topic. Will often claim to be goth or punk in their social media bios but listen to stuff like Billie Eilish, Freddie dredd (no disrespect to those artists the fan bases are just annoying!) and basically any catchy song on tiktok. While we got bullied in middleschool for making our own clothes and talking about bands our parents probably liked 30 years ago, these guys got glorified in highschool for being the romanticized version of us and looking like Ramona flowers! Also, but not always they‚Äôre probably upper middle class or upper class. How else can they afford to get so much overpriced stuff from dollskill? Sometimes they‚Äôre just misunderstanding about the subcultures and really nice people, but most of the times they‚Äôre conformists and look at us like we‚Äôre crazy in the hallways. 

2. Asshole punks  

Would 10/10 call me a slur in the hallway and then say ‚Äúit was just a joke! Don‚Äôt be so offended!‚Äù. Mistakes songs like guilty for being white as an excuse for them to be racist or something, despite not actually knowing what the lyrics were about. Thinks being predjudiced is somehow ‚Äúalternative‚Äù because ‚Äúeverybody‚Äôs so sensitive nowadays‚Äù. Tend to be eltitists, but not always. This is a pretty small minority of people, but I have met a few online. 


3. SJW ‚Äúpunks‚Äù 

Kind of the crazy sibling of the asshole punks. Often will claim to be punk but are actually just PATD, 21 pilots, or fallout boy fans and probably conformists. They endorse cancel culture like it‚Äôs some sacred ritual, and probably spend a lot of their time on twitter complaining about how problematic a person is, instead of actually paying attention to real issues like the police, femicide in mexico, the murders of black and trans people, and a list that could go on. Probably likes Steven universe to an unhealthy degree. Would probably vote for biden, and probably gets really angry if you make any type of slightly offensive joke. I‚Äôve met people like this and they absolutely drove me insane! Probably one of the worst on this list tbh. I think this group is kinda dying out now, but it‚Äôs still pretty big imo. 


4. The perky/enthusiastic punks
 
really genuine people! They‚Äôre probably starved of punk/alternative friends so when they meet someone with a mild interest in the subculture they could talk about their favorite bands for HOURS. generally pretty nice and open to new people, definitely not elitists. Musicians I‚Äôve met like this tend to be absolute music nerds and are really nice to talk to, especially if you‚Äôre new to playing! They‚Äôll throw album recommendations at you like wildfire. They‚Äôre down for almost anything from watching a movie to exploring the woods and can be pretty energetic. Just really happy punk folk! I think this is a pretty moderate to small amount of gen z alt kids, which makes me bummed cause I love hanging around them! 


5. FERAL artists 

these guys are weird, but pleasant. A lot of them I‚Äôve met really like newer, art punk bands like the garden. Their art tends to be really experimental but still have a real centralized punk-esque vibe to them. A lot of crazy colors, DIY projects, and weird ideas. They can be really funny in my experience, and tend to kinda be all over the place. I think this is a small but growing amount of people! Every time I go on social media to check out new artists I‚Äôm finding more like this, which makes me happy cause the art is always something new but still related to punk ideology or music. 

6. Outliers 

This is a nice group, and pretty big I think. For this I‚Äôm including not just punks but a large portion of metalheads. They tend to be really chill and enjoy talking about music casually, but they‚Äôre not exactly stone punk/goth/whatever else. These people have probably existed ever since the subcultures started! They like the music, subculture etc but aren‚Äôt really exactly active participants, which is still cool! They may attend a few shows here and there though, and in my experience they‚Äôre always happy to support the local scene and artists. 


And yeah! That‚Äôs all the categories I can think of lol."

2184,poppunkers,poppunkers,"...I think these people don't get nearly as much recognition about how much they've ingrained pop punk music into the brains of many gamers back in the day. Imagine being a kid or teenager back in 2004, and hearing the opening vocals of [The F-Ups's Lazy Generation](https://youtu.be/7-rpBB6O_Io) in Burnout 3: Takedown's intro, and then the riff kicks in. Shit was wild. And then you are greeted to the rest of soundtrack, just full of bangers from bands that ranged from popular acts (The Bouncing Souls, The Ramones, Jimmy Eat World), now-popular bands that back in the day weren't nearly as famous as they are now (Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance), and just overall more obscure artists (The F-Ups, Chronic Future, The Von Bondies); the soundtrack was just so full of something for everyone that wanted to get their rock fix, and that wasn't just limited to pop punk either. The soundtrack also had a bunch of songs from straight up punk rock, dance-punk, indie rock, post-hardcore and metalcore bands. Also fun little thing, [the soundtrack for Burnout 3 is currently rated 4.06 out of 5 in RYM lol](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/comp/various-artists/burnout-3-takedown/)

By Revenge, Criterion varied up the soundtrack a little, taking a little bit off the focus of the pop punk by adding electronic music and tracks from darker and more aggressive bands, although it still quite a lot of pop punk, if this lineup of artists (Goldfinger, FOB, The Academy Is..., The All-American Rejects, MxPx, Unwritten Law) is to tell us something. And on Dominator/Paradise (both of these games had more or less the same songs, but each release had extra songs or songs that were removed), they pretty much made the most eclectic soundtrack on the series to date, but of course they didn't take away [our pop punk fix, heh.](https://youtu.be/0QooLeTsFGk) Oh, and if you're into Avril Lavigne, they also had [Girlfriend](https://youtu.be/KTiuB9CZSdw) in it, lol. Hell, they even added different versions of the song in other languages in Dominator from 2007, as it was where she actually premiered the song one month before *The Best Damn Thing* actually came out, although the single came earlier

Okay, it is obvious this is just me gushing out about how much I love the music in these games, but it is undeniable how much I know and love in not only the pop punk scene, but also metalcore, post-hardcore, and indie rock as well, and I have nobody to thank but these beautiful games, and Criterion for curating these bad boys for our teenage virgin ears to be exposed to. lmao

So what do y'all think? You got exposed to pop punk by these games too? Hell, if there is a game in general that also introduced you to that genre just say it as well, haha"

Today I'm bringing back Pretty Boy Thorson &amp; The Falling Angels first, and in my opinion best record Take it Easy. This your classic breakup /  holy cowza I hate myself record that I can really get behind. Full of classics like Dear Jenny, Sweet Heart, Try to Get Some Sleep, and a fkin great 2 track closer I Should Really Move Out of the Alamo and Remembers the Lillies of the God Damn Field. If you haven't listened to this do yourself a favor today and throw it on.

I would like some album recommendations.

I enjoy the following albums almost too much: 

The Story So Far: Self titled, Under Soil and Dirt, What you don‚Äôt see 
- i am a fan of Proper Dose, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything that has that sound 

Knuckle Puck: Copacetic, Shapeshifter 

Neck Deep: Life‚Äôs not out to get you 

Belmont: Self titled 

Gold Route: Prosper, White Knuckles 

I am also into some not so Pop Punk stuff, although i believe the qualities of this music are similar: 

Hail The Sun/Sianvar : entire discographies 


A Lot Like Birds: Conversation Piece, DIVISI 

Dance Gavin Dance: Downtown Battle Mountain, Instant Gratification 

Chiodos: All‚Äôs well that ends well 

Saosin: Translating the name 


I also enjoy a lot of prog metal, math rock, and instrumental music. So I have a liking for heavier punchier stuff, I enjoy people who are ‚Äútechnically‚Äù experts at their perspective instruments. I love soaring melodies, angst, and boo-hoo wa-wa music. Thanks for reading!"

If I am being honest, I lost my love for it over time. Don't get me wrong! I still listen to Neck Deep and With Confidence's most recent record is incredible beyond words. It's not just the music though.  The community (not everyone) became toxic in a sense.  Anytime a band tries to experiment with a different pop punk style with adding different elements to it, they're bashed and told they sold out in a sense. Literally I'll see so many people just tearing their new shit apart because they dared to use a different guitar sound instead of just distortion. It's depressing.

The fact that some people think you have to fit under a certain way of being and dressing to be accepted as punk is ridiculous.

Mike from [Call In Dead](https://www.facebook.com/Callindeadofficial/) here... as you may or may not know, May is Mental Health Awareness month. I do not usually get personal online, but I personally struggle and have for a long time. In times like these the struggle is harder than ever for a lot of people. The first thing I want to say is suicide is never the answer. Also no matter how bad things get YOU ARE NOT ALONE! There is always someone or something there that can help. As I grow and get older I discover more and more friends, family, fellow musicians and chefs that struggle daily and keep things internal. Finding the strength to get up and carry on daily is a task in and of itself. That is where the point of this comes in. We are doing a complete charity donation sale and releasing limited CID masks, as well as matching all received donations up to $200. All merch and music purchased from our [Bandcamp](https://callindeadfl.bandcamp.com/) for the rest of May and any masks purchased until they are out of stock will go to the [Mental Health Association of Central Florida](https://www.facebook.com/mhacf/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAbY4IXvZAyFOuMqia9WbPWhSC8MSmedY10N0TebxPTuse2PFanu0vqI17_Y5q839aVhUkY_Ctd65DF&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA3WCtEzrluvquRJ7hGsA3Nb3tv33NXLNNldRMVtcIaN9hzReJwNqRS8ijhOU-58u9wSX0N8jDgXCOA9k6V-STi2UkALkHlzsFhc3ZHNK5qBhvXQfXyQq4cSr_x9t6pVLGux64Z9E5ScOe0H0bPSqY7yniqoZ1RPDscH904fyCWnilv_PPmRJJ6oxk4aiP5uk4gmRqyFFDFH15j6v8AL8BzQ8dAhOhKwjg_e7TqBJKO6O5ZDviGs9Xg4uDksK1xAeLRYLrtUbhGnJaRl1ZKA0NcoYD4_ulQ-zDxwqFTDOTvPnxFf8xwKxp-byokAv2aeRCOLc9mopX8_mFO73KPILU). All shipping fees are being waived. We will also be offering a $20 Mental Health Month bundle that includes the following: F@#$%&amp; Suicide bracelets, the face mask, a t-shirt, a beer koozie and a CD w/digital download. Regardless of sales, Call in Dead will donate a minimum of $100, so if we hit our goal, we will donate all of the money you spend, plus up to $300 ($100 of our own + up to $200 to match your sales) of our own money. Thank you for your support, we are here for you as well as organizations like this. Remember Stay Strong in this daily fight... and again suicide is never the answer! Let‚Äôs come together as a scene and a community... hell as humanity and reach out and support each other! üíö

1958,poppunkers,poppunkers,"So I probably didn't get properly into Pop Punk until about 2010-2012 and therefore I missed the previous era.

Following watching The Cozy Representative's video about The Academy Is..., I gave them a listen and honestly have just completely fallen in love with them.

Each of the 3 albums are fantastic in their own way and honestly I'm amazed this band didn't take off more. I feel like they really struck that sweet spot between being accessible enough but also having a unique flair that I haven't heard from others. It seems like their biggest problem compared to others of similar caliber at the time is that there was no obvious breakout hit, like a Curse of Curves or Face Down.

I'm really hopeful that they might tour again one day and I'll have a chance to see them. Slam Dunk often gets reunions from legacy bands and I'm really hopeful they might get The Academy Is... next year or in the future!

I thought I would give everyone the chance to listen to a fuckin awesome local band in the Seattle area, Neutralboy! . They've been around for 28 years and still makin great punk rock music. They try to tour through out the states as much as they can when all 3 band mates schedules are flexible enough, so you may already know who they are if you're into the local underground punk rock scene.

So, click the links, sit back, relax and enjoy listening to a great underground local Seattle area band.

Lead singer Mike's solo 'Evil Fucker' music is also online now.

Neutralboy!'s next show is Tuesday the 17th of March at O'Malley's Irish pud 2403 6th ave in Tacoma, Wa.

They will also be going on a small tour this April in Colorado.

I am interested in having some punk email penpals, mostly outside of the United States.

I am male, live in Salt Lake City, sing and play bass in a kind of anarcho-Oi type band, and I'm in some other bands also.

I write zines, organize all ages punk shows, run a cassette label, run a distro, make buttons, and brew cider.

I like mostly old UK punk. My favorite bands are The Exploited, Violators, Attak, Chaos, Special Duties, Chron Gen.

My favorite American bands are The Plasmatics, Toxic Reasons, and Devo.

I collect, make, and pirate VHS tapes.

Besides VHS, I'm into weird radio stuff, trash culture, vintage electronics, and striving to be more self-reliant. 

I don't use Facebook or any other social media. I think it is a disease, to be honest. 

My plans for the pandemic are to grow my own food, brew and drink more cider, and do a bunch of weird arcane shit with electronics.

To start the last 3 times I've seen them live the tickets were $50+ and they only played 16 songs. 16 songs is a lot for smaller bands with 2-3 albums but ADTR has 6 albums worth of songs to pick from. For comparison the wonder years have 5 major albums and play 20+ songs normally. (This is for headlining shows)

ADTR did the most punk rock thing possible by ditching their record label and starting their own. Then they did the most unpunk rock thing by joining fueled my ramen where good pop punk bands historically go to make tons of money and put out music that is not pop punk. If you're unfamiliar with this look at the list of bands on fueled my ramen and see how many of them use to be at the forefront of pop punk and now make radio friendly pop.

Finally ADTR originally announced they'd be releasing a new album in the fall of 2019 (I believe that is accurate but correct me if I'm wrong). The announcement came with degenerates being released which is nothing short of a stadium friendly rock song that sounds nothing like ADTR. I'm all for bands pushing their sound but that was more of a giant leap than a push. Now maybe they really do want to completely change their sound but it definitely seems like they're just going for a radio friendly sound. Also the album has been delayed due to what they claim is the artwork not being done (personally I'm hoping they listened to the entire album and hated the sound and decided to redo it). This claim was made in January or February and since that time they have released multiple lines of new merch with no album in sight. 

Basically ADTR seems like they're just trying to make more money while giving up on their original sound."

I'd hypothesise that most people who listen to one genre of music the majority of the time relate to the emotional expression of artists within that genre. I'm not sure why but I'm not often deeply moved by songs outside of this genre - maybe I just need to branch out more.

This is definitely a random question and I don't even know if it's allowed, but I'd love to hear a song outside of the pop-punk genre that hits hard for you. For me it's [Sad Forever by Lauv](https://youtu.be/Klsi8CbSm8Y)."

Well, I‚Äôve liked 2 of the songs released. When You Know and Lowlife (admittedly, Lowlife has only just gotten in the top 2). All the others are extremely mediocre (IN MY OPINION) and I‚Äôm not excited. They sound like naff b-sides and and bens voice is really grating on me. 

So there I was, listening to their songs desperately trying to like them, then I realised...I actually don‚Äôt give a toss about pop/punk anymore. Ever since I was a teenager (now approaching 30) I‚Äôve always said that pop/punk was my favourite genre of music and everything else (literally everything else, I like jazz, pop, rap, classical etc) came behind that. Now recently I feel that pop/punk just isn‚Äôt hitting that spot anymore. They all have the same sound, there‚Äôs no songs that give me that buzz anymore. 

Maybe I‚Äôm growing up? Or maybe pop/punk really is a mediocre genre nowadays?

Some of my favorites are Not Now by Blink-182, No Sensitivity by Jimmy Eat World, Lights Out by Green Day, and A Dolphin is just a Shark with a Smile by FYS.

2122,poppunkers,poppunkers,"1. It still sounds like neck deep. Very polished and palatable, but I can hear the neck deep in there. Some surprises but Sam Carter was a similar surprise on TPATP.

2. The first half is a lot more traditional neck deep sounding, I found the last 5 or 6 tracks to be the most experimental and on the poppy side

3. Some songs were an awesome roller coaster that surprised me multiple times but in a great way. It‚Äôs like I wasn‚Äôt hearing what I wanted or expected to hear right then, but I actually liked what I was hearing way more than what I thought I wanted. An example would be the end of Pushing Daisies.

4. Some of the pop songs are really heavily and obviously auto tuned, but surprisingly I enjoyed the sound of it. It‚Äôs not T-pain like, but more spacey and reverby. Really smooth. I think it‚Äôs a cool sound.

5. Somehow all the songs are unbelievably catchy, and yet so forgettable. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible, but none of those songs really stuck with me when I was done, but when they were playing I was jamming my head off. Might be the weed.

6. I‚Äôm not judging this album too critically regarding the message of the concept or the lyrical content - This album makes me want to dance to almost every song. It‚Äôs a fun album, and I had a lot of fun listening to it.

7. Ben seems happy as fuck in his new relationship and that happiness is pretty contagious in a lot of the songs. They‚Äôre cheese but they get me thinking about my girl and smiling like a fool.

8. I like the vocal effects a lot, even if they push the album to a super poppy side. I think they‚Äôre cool and they surprised me the first time around. I like the distortion in Sick Joke. 

Neck Deep did a great job making a fun album that makes me wanna dance."

Ex: if you don't have a locally owned record store in your town you can go the website of a locally owned store in my area https://www.graywhaleslc.com/ they are offering free shipping anywhere in the US on any order over 25 dollars (plus they also sell movies and games so you don't have to go to Amazon for those either).

I will always love their first few albums. They are incredible and can be played start to finish. I just wish they were still producing music like that. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm just nostalgic on this Saturday night. Hope you are all staying healthy."
3006,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Saw someone else do this yesterday but they were asking for more poppy recommendations like all time low. I‚Äôm looking for bands that fit the category of a little more hardcore but still catchy and meaningful. 

Preferably newer bands but old bands will work too. 
Preferably ones that still tour. 


Examples of what I like:

ADTR 

Trash Boat 

Neck Deep

Real Friends 

Capstan 

Movements 

Grayscale 

The story so far 




I also like

Stand Atlantic 

State champs 

Wonder years 

Paramore 

Fall out boy 

Mayday 



I‚Äôm leaning towards the first grouping so if anyone has other bands that go pretty hard like ADTR but also are catchy/hard like Neck Deep but I‚Äôm pretty open so just give me what you got!"

I saw my reflection and saw that my hair was messed up from doing this and I said to my self ""I need a hair cut, but I can't go anywhere to get it done due to lock down."" I sometimes buzz my hair down in the summer so I have a clippers on hand, and since it's getting warmer I decided to just get rid of it. Then I came to the realization that I would not see anyone for a while and I wanted to give myself a mohawk. I have never had one and always wanted to try it.

1302,punk,punk," I don't know if this post is going to be well-received nor answered. I've tried to post it in the metal sub-reddit, but it's not accepted. Let me tell you that I'm not here to create any problems or any dramas or whatever. I'm just here because I want to know things, you all have a better knowledge about music than me.

I'm a metal fan,  it's been years I've been listening to it and it remains today my favorite genre of music. I can easily make the differences between the sub-genres, but I sometimes have trouble to distinguish metal with what we would call ""hardcore"" today. I know that hardcore punk is initially a more aggressive version of punk rock, but ever since, I feel like a lot of hardcore bands sounds more metal than punk, and when I hear other sub-genres such as ""New York hardcore"", ""powerviolence"" or ""beatdown"", I feel like I'm actually listening to metal with a punk attitude.

But the question is, is it metal-sounding punk, or does the ""extreme sound"" of metal actually roots from punk? Was I wrong since the beginning about metal being the dark, nasty, heavy music that most people describes, and that hardcore punk is the true underground music that people would define as ""screaming over noise""?. It's something I've been wondering about since I've started my researches about the history of metal music and its relationship with punk. 

That's not all, I've also learned that other things we tend to see in metal shows, such as mosh pits, circle pits, walls of death, screaming and growls, would have come from punk bands, or bands that were punk. All of this makes me feel ""betrayed"" by metal, because everything I love about it; the dark, heavy, nasty-sounding music as well as the harsh vocals, were rooted from punk, and not from metal, as I thought at the beginning, and probably as most of people who are not familiar with it thinks.

I'm talking about extreme metal, because it's usually the image people have when you talk about it. I know that traditional heavy metal like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath don't have punk influences and are ""pure metal"", but even if it's still darker and heavier than Hard Rock, it is probably not what people nowadays would define as ""metal"", but ""some hard rock"". 

There's only one thing that could change of all the thoughts I've just mentioned. **Is Hardcore Punk on its own influenced by heavy metal?** Is it the result of punk rock wanting to be more extreme by using elements from heavy metal? If it's the case, then I think it would explain the mutual influences that both genres had along with the time.

I'm not saying I dislike punk or anything, I do like the music. So, here are my questions, which I hope will be answered for me to understand things better.

1. Was hardcore punk in general influenced by metal? Or is it the opposite? Or both?
2. What metal sub-genres would have not existed without hardcore?
3. What sub-genres of metal would have existed without hardcore?
4. How would you define Mot√∂rhead and The Melvins?
5. Is there any rivalry between those two genres, or fans?

And finally, are all of these thoughts even necessary? Because, after all, it's the result that matters, no? It's music after all. Both metal and punk would have not existed without rock, which would have not existed without blues, and so on.

I hope you will understand me."

Why does Blink get to be so big but someone with amazing songs like this that have these deep, philosophical meanings get ignored?

1. Coming too close
2.A postcard would be nice
3. Friends of the enemy
4. Why doesnt anybody like me
5. The answer is still no

8. Secret
9. Invincible
10. Soul mate
Tony sly also did his own acoustic albums, and I would recommend starting with sad bear. It just sucks that they were so good, but never became the rockstar they dreamt of being or getting the recognition they deserve. Let's carry on their legacy."

 [This tweet](https://twitter.com/licknord/status/1252688482436333569?s=21) has resonated with twitter and has people making google spreadsheets and whatever else to narrow down the list of possible suspects.

Last I checked, the top suspects are apart of Miss May I, We Came as Romans, Man Overboard, and We Are the In Crowd. 

What started as kind of a strange witch-hunt has now turned into a charity fundraiser according to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/licknord/status/1253509245640806401?s=21) that announces that the culprit has agreed to reveal themselves if $10,000 is raised.

799,punk,punk,"Like all of us here, it baffles me when I hear people getting pissed about punk being political. Not only for how blatantly ignorant it is, but because punk music is literally the thing that introduced me to radical politics. 

I imagine mine is a pretty familiar story for people here. Being raised in the White Protestant Mid-West, I was spoon fed all the patriotism and individualistic bullshit from the system and from my dad (a crazy caricature of White Privilege). And at first I accepted them at face value. 

As I grew older I started to see the world as it was, despite my surroundings, and around the same time discovered punk rock. The music itself hooked me from the beginning.

As I listened more and more, I started to really hear the lyrics the music I now could not stop listening to. They expressed my perceptions in ways I never could and further steeled my resolve. Other people, well educated and skilled people, were seeing the same things I saw. And have been since before I was born. 

To me, punk rock is the antithesis to the thesis that is our society. Oh 'Merica is so perfect and wonderful you say?  Let me tell you about the corruption, the police brutality, the treatment of immigrants, working class living conditions, pollution, mental instability, prison labour, urbanization, our morally bankrupt healthcare system, the horrors that our military commit in the name of our corporate Empire, ect. 

Without punk rock I probably would've been just another white religious conservative, ringing my hands at all this terrible loss of property and hoping our Dear Leader can protect us from the evil non-christians."
453,punk,punk,So I think crossover thrash is good. Considering i've listened to the Suicidal Tendencies self titled album and The Age of Quarrel by Cro-Mags. Personally I like the genre and I was wondering what you guys think of Crossover Thrash.
1915,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Never been into this band but their new song I am loving majorly.

I feel like I‚Äôve given maaaany of the bands discussed on here a listen at one point or another, many bands I am now a fan of some aren‚Äôt for me. Hoping someone can guide me to other bands with the vibe of the new Seaway song, or even material in their discography with this vibe. Thanks!!!"
198,punk,punk,"This is something I've been thinking about lately and I wanted to ask you guys because I know a lot of you are more familiar with punk than I am.


My understanding is that punk began as a rebellion and critisicm against the standards and elitism that was being built as rock bands got more and more extravagant. To me, that's what punk is. Going against standards and doing your own thing. The issue with that is punk has its own standards now, which seems a little silly to me. Some things considered ""punk"" like the whole ripped jeans and leather jackets look followed the spirit of punk back when it was starting but don't as much now, yet there are those (and not a lot, I know this community cracks down on gatekeepers) that consider those aspects of how punk manifested then as how punk should be now.

It's kind of like how indie music was originally music released independently but now there's record labels just for indie music. Progressive rock started as a way to explore the boundaries of the genre and propel the music forward but now it's a genre of it's own with new boundaries of what's considered progressive or not.


So do you think punk is a genre or the concept of not following ridiculous standards?"

2635,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Pure Noise Records recently posted a picture on instagram of this vinyl and made me think about the one I ordered. 

Wondering if anyone else has one and can confirm/deny the pictures in the photo album are the same in each copy? Or is there some variety in them?

Also, did I get #12 or 72???

2738,poppunkers,poppunkers,"If you could snap your fingers a band would be made with a certain sound how would that band sound?

I‚Äôd love to see what a band would sound like if they had a +44 / Alkaline Trio style sound mainly but also now and then had breakdowns and screams similar to ADTR"
3322,poppunkers,poppunkers,I‚Äôll be in town for training for work and I was wondering if there were any good shows during that time I should check out.
1254,punk,punk,"I know of a few punk places in london like Underground in camden and places like that but i don't wanna go to a show just yet as i'm a young girl and i don't know anyone else who likes punk.

2499,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hey All,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a transgender woman and god willing i'll be having a surgery on my vocal chords at the end of this year. I have always wanted to make some type of video where I would sing a traditionally ""male"" part with my current voice, and a traditionally ""female"" part after the FemLAR. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the only candidates that I can think of that I ""like"" are :

Bend your arms to look like wings - Funeral for a Friend

When I get home you're so dead - Mayday Parade

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, those are both boy/boy duets. Just looking for more options in the poppunk / Emo esque genre.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"
382,punk,punk,I (19f) recently decided to fully invest myself in punk culture because I've always agreed with the political and moral beliefs and loved some of the music.

Or if we're talking even further back, Man Overboard, All Time Low, the Starting Line, etc. 

I'm looking for more inspiration for how these type of bands go about writing their music in contrast to bands where the lead vocalist doesn't have to worry about playing and singing at the same time."
2138,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Ive just finished a first listen through, and while it's not LNOTGY, it's also not 2015 anymore and come on guys, it's time to move on. Just on its own merits, All Distortions Are Intentional is a phenomenal pop record with some killer pop punk tracks thrown in too, and is every bit Neck Deep as the rest of them.

Telling Stories feels familiar in the best kind of way and Pushing Daisies is arguably one of their best tracks in years. The double whammy of Sonderland/Fall at the start hits so hard, and that's coming from someone who really wasn't a fan of the latter when it first dropped.

Definitely gonna give it a few more listens before I form a proper opinion, but at a first glance it's so much better than I expected."
831,punk,punk,"Looking for some new music. Maybe you know a band that is worth listening. I like LoC, rancid, misfits, NOFX, bouncing souls etc. So that pretty normal punk stuff, no screaming. Also would be great it was a younger band and not some mid 50s. Thank you."

 We were so scared to push ourselves because of the cost of studio time and the risk of getting a record deal was too out there. 
 We‚Äôre about to release our first 5 song ‚Äúep,‚Äù because we can. The fact that we can do it makes me wonder how many other people are doing it. I would love to make a playlist of only DIY bands starting off on Spotify.

2520,punk,poppunkers,I know I‚Äôve seen multiple singers do it but I feel like I saw Parker do it the most often. Did he start it and other people followed suit or was it just kind of born out of the scene in general?
3124,poppunkers,poppunkers,"As the title said, I attended the worst show I have ever seen. Have Mercy is my favorite band. Has been since about 2015. This was maybe my fifth time seeing them. Every time I have seen them, it has always topped the previous show. This is their final tour, the last time I will ever see them live! And I really wish I didnt go so I could hold on to those better memories. This was just sad.


 Brian, the singer, looked like he was in another world. His eyes were rolling back in his head almost the whole time. He laid down on the stage but it was very bizarre. He only sang, a liberal estimate, 30% of each song. They seemed like they didnt want to be there at all. At the end, Brian just walked away. No goodbye. Nothing. I felt like we were being dismissed. It was honestly heartbreaking.


I want to be pissed, but I'm just disappointed. And scared honestly. Brian seems like he needs help and I hope he gets it. 


I don't feel like they owe me anything. They have given me happiness and help throughout the years. I just wanted a good send off for them. Have Mercy has helped me through really bad times and I truly want the best for those guys. It just sucks that my last impression of them will be this event."
724,punk,punk,"Pop punk led the current ""punk is dead"" sentiment by somehow comercializing the ""fuck the system"" attitude and selling individuality through musical expression with formulaic anti-authority anthems. Green day was on the forefront of this era and I cannot deny that but I don't think green day themselves weren't punk, at least to a point. They came to the mainstream at a time when the populace needed a counter-culture movement and, to their detrement, they were lumped into the deluge of punk acts not actually challenging social norms. I do think they've since lost their edge but while most green day apologists say dookie was the last truly punk album, I'm willing to toss in american idiot as well"
2000,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I‚Äôve been severely depressed on and off for about two years now. Throughout my lowest times I‚Äôve played this album almost on repeat. I‚Äôd always listen to the title track with a sense of hope and wishful thinking, maybe one day I can sing along and actually mean it. Then as I was sat in my room on Saturday, writing about my upcoming 25th birthday (which was on Monday), Free Throw booming through my headphones, I suddenly thought maybe I‚Äôm nearly there. Not completely by any means but nearly. These past few days I have felt GOOD and not just ok for the first time in several years and I‚Äôm trying to embrace every moment of calm I have. It feels amazing to be able to listen to music from a new perspective. I love pop punk because it discusses these topics and without PUP, Neck Deep and Free Throw I don‚Äôt know if ever would‚Äôve got out of my  goddamn rut!"

I saw the lyrics of this song on someone‚Äôs t-shirt online. It was a provocative lyric like ‚ÄúI wanna destroy myself‚Äù ‚ÄúI hate everything‚Äù something like that. The lyric following was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kill my mom‚Äù or a variation of killing their mother specifically.

2531,poppunkers,poppunkers,Hey poppunkers - We put out our first official full length album. Check it out at Bandcamp. [http://ihatethemoguls.bandcamp.com](http://ihatethemoguls.bandcamp.com) or on any streaming platforms. Enjoy!
1621,punk,punk,"The Dickies. Toy Dolls. 
They are both awesome bands. Is it PUNK?"
2384,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Listening to Candour by Neck Deep while looking at my late grandpa's pictures.

Any song recommendations that relates to a Dad/grandpa dying?"
3571,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Okay this happened a minute ago but I thought you all might appreciate this story. After the Wonder Years show in Minneapolis MN last year. A friend and I were burning a cigarette outside of this bar/ restaurant right next to the venue the wonder years just Fucking killed a show at. Anyway after a nice cigarette and some kind conversation with other concert  goers we popped back into the bar. My friend and I are just shooting the shit when suddenly he says ‚Äúdude soupey is right behind you‚Äù. And I figured man fuck my friend we‚Äôve been talking shit all night no Fucking way soupey is behind me. Then I turn around and literally say ‚Äúoh fucking shit that‚Äôs Dan Campbell‚Äù. Fist and only time in my life over genuinely been star shocked. I go up to the dude I shake his hand and I tell him he played a killer show that night, and like an absolute humble gentleman he simply says ‚Äúthanks man glad you enjoyed the show. Than you for coming out‚Äù. Like dude I just met the coolest guy on the Fucking earth and he is just a humble and kind person. It was by far one of the coolest moments of my life. We didn‚Äôt want to bother him because we figured everyone would be coming up to him that night. So my friend and I just chilled at the bar and kept sipping PBRs and watching person after person come up to soupey. After a hot minute the rest of the band came in and joined him. It was honestly one of the coolest moments of my life and a day I will never forget."
3469,punk,poppunkers,"I just found a band called A Heartwell Ending, and through a bit of searching found they then changed their name to Call the Cops, but I'm not really sure as the only info on them is old websites and one mentioned the name change. ahe has one album in 2006, ctc has an ep and album in 2009/10.

I just want to know what happened to them but can't find anything."
545,punk,punk,"Hi people, I'm kind of new on Reddit. Anyway, with a couple of friends we have a thrash metal-punk-crust  band (I don't know how to categorize it, you've gotta listen to it) and I was wondering if you wanted to hear it. We are from Los √Ångeles, Chile (yes, there is a Los √Ångeles in Chile). We are beginning with this, we have a demo from 2014, but it sounds kind of shitty. Nowadays we are trying to get the songs well recorded in order to do an album called ""Estado de Cat√°strofe"", meaning ""State of emergency"" or ""State of catastrophe"". Basically I post this here, because we are into the punk scene here and our songs could have ""punk lyrics"".   


You can find all our social media down in the description of the video.

1438,punk,punk,"I‚Äôm a baby punk who just got into the scene maybe a year ago. 

One of the first old school punk bands that I had heard about were the Sex Pistols. 

I know about their history, and how they brought to light the punk movement in Britain with their anti-royal family message. 

My question, however, is mainly about their song ‚Äúbodies‚Äù. Many people see it as anti-abortion, which is not a very punk statement, but some people see it differently. 

I just wanted to know your guys‚Äô opinion."
3462,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hey! Is anyone going to the grayscale/hotmulligan show in Tampa next weekend? I‚Äôm looking for some people to meet up with, I‚Äôm from the Savannah Georgia area."
844,punk,punk,"With all the unrest in the world right now, I find myself scared shitless when I'm going out to protests for the Black Lives Matter movement. Punks always seem fearless and as a baby punk sometimes I feel like a poser for being afraid. I'm not letting it stop me but I definitely have to make a conscious effort so my friends around me dont know I'm scared because I know that would make them even more hesitant to continue to come with me to protests."
3648,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hi! Happy New Year everyone!

So I‚Äôve been listening to pop punk for almost 15 years now, but I never actually payed a lot of attention to different eras of the genre and how it changed it. 

I guess we have 
- pre 2000s 
- 2000s genre explosion era
- 2006 - 2009 era (which I completely missed for some reason )
- 2010 revival era 
- And now what? Genre decline?

Well is it correct?
Also can you please name some most influential bands from 2006 - 2009. All I can think about is Set Your Goals maybe."
1998,poppunkers,poppunkers,This is definitely my favorite song on the album. Love the lyrics. What do you think the meaning is?
76,punk,punk,"I'm currently putting patches on a jacket of mine and was wondering if putting a strokes patch would be accepted?(which I guess goes against punk ideology, but besides that)
I'm new within ""punk"" fashion and even though the strokes is pretty involved in garage punk I've seen a couple people say they arent.  

If it helps the question it will also be accompanied with black flag, fuck nazis, ACAB, and f*g patches (among other things/patches)"
745,punk,punk,I grew up listening to some some great anti bush/war punk music. What are some new songs that exemplify that punk ethos of fuck the Government.

3506,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Thanks pop punk and emo, when my life gets shitty, you‚Äôre like an old friend, you‚Äôre simple, you talk with your heart, your melodies warm up my heart, you feel like someone I could tell my problems without being judged. No matter how far I am, I always come back to you. You only need few chords on a guitar and simple poetry to make me feel better. You don‚Äôt care about what people think of you, you can scream your feelings and still make people sing along.

I‚Äôm 26, I guess this wasn‚Äôt a phase mom, I‚Äôve been listening to pop punk since 16 years now. I lied too many times telling myself I will move on, my life will get better and I won‚Äôt need these lyrics to fill the emptiness in my heart but this isn‚Äôt true. I feel sad right now, I had no one to talk about this, my friends aren‚Äôt around and don‚Äôt even care anyways. But you have always been there for me.

Don‚Äôt say everything is meant to be because it‚Äôs not what I believe.

Forever friends... ‚ù§Ô∏è"
244,punk,punk,"This easily could be bullshit but I‚Äôm curious if anyone has any info on this.  Besides this hearsay accusation I can‚Äôt find anything else about the topic online.  Anyone have more info?

2666,poppunkers,poppunkers,I can even figure out what tuning they‚Äôre in. Maybe it‚Äôs in standard and I suck at guitar but the chords in the chorus don‚Äôt sound like it.
454,punk,punk,"Of you guys are into it, I'm going to nostalgia you up with a series of punk live recordings from the late 70s/early 80s in the San Francisco Bay area.  All taped by the magnificent Terry Hammer.  If you aren't into me posting these, just tell me fuckoff.

Here's the 1st one I want to share.  

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1UobsTWA35t5eIBmUjW1QbsdntokC-DfU

Dead Kennedys Mabuhay Gardens San Francisco, CA 1980-04-05 THTP Release 5.

Holiday In Cambodia &gt; Dirk outro Length: 45:19 Band: Jello Biafra (Eric Reed Boucher)- vocals East Bay Ray (Raymond Pepperell) - guitar Klaus Flouride (Geoffrey Lyall) - bass Ted (Bruce Slesinger) - drums, percussion Notes: * This is an amazing recording. Especially considering how densely packed the Mab was during good shows. * Straight from 1980 to you, and it's almost as if you were there. How can this happen? Well, ok, minus the sweat, spit, blood, and frenzy of the audience. =========================================================== No distribution in lossy formats!! No selling!! No bootlegs!! No remastering!! Yes sharing. Definitely share. Support the artists when or if they play, and buy their records/merchandise. Please make an effort to pick at least one of these THTP releases and keep it seeded for as long as you can, particularly the lesser known groups. That will really help out long term. Please correct any errors or oversights in this information in the comments section so the information can be as accurate as possible. =========================================================== Someone put my feelings very well about these recordings in the following quote. I can't really improve on their words beyond noting that these recordings sound absolutely and utterly stunning, and I consider myself incredibly lucky to be able to present these to you here in their original, first generation, lossless hi-fidelity versions, for the first time ever. ""[These recordings were] recorded and preserved by collector/engineer Terry Hammer, for broadcast over the UC Berkeley station KALX and several others from the 1979 -1981 period. Anyone who spent a night at one of these clubs knows how chaotic the atmosphere was. That he was able to, not only get a decent feed from the sound mixing board, but was also able to get clean recordings was something of a miracle. And the fact this guy did it over and over again is pure dedication to the cause of preserving history for decades to come. Fortunately for everyone, he‚Äôs been making these gems of history available and their value as historic documents is inestimable. This is really exciting stuff and I am grateful for Terry‚Äôs foresight and deft skill."" src: https://pastdaily.com/2014/06/25/gang-four-live-american-indian-center-san-francisco-1980-nights-roundtable-concert-edition/ If you've ever been looking for an excuse to upgrade your sound system, these recordings certainly should provide you with some motivation, because they have incredible sound. And if you already have a quality sound system, you are in for a treat!! The audio goes straight to 20k hz, no losses I can detect. Due to the reality of tapes, even high end as used here, the low end starts at 47 hz. Do we call these soundboards? Technically not precisely because this is not the house mix, these shows were mixed using a dedicated mixing board. And the recordings include 1 audience mic in the mix. But I call it the Terry Hammer Tape Project (THTP) to make sure there is no doubt about the project's creator. - teetering"

482,punk,punk,"I've been trying to get the delay set just right for a cover of the song, but I can never seem to get it... None of the presets I have are right, some are really close but are just off enough to annoy me. üòÇ Thought I'd post here since I can't find an answer anywhere online."
12,punk,punk,"This is slightly tongue in cheek, but it keeps happening to me.  I've had the same army jacket for over 20 years now, I think my mom got it from army supply when I was a kid, just the standard BDU fatigues.  I usually roll the sleeves up and wear it with jeans and a black hat with &lt;insert punk tshirt here&gt; underneath.  And I've had dozens of times where people have come up to me assuming I'm not only in the service but actively on the job.  And I can't figure out if it's just that people are dumb or I give off some sort of vibe.  I was raised in a military family so I guess that could be it.  I guess I also have that tight ass football player look to me.

The one that really blew my mind was when I went to pick my mom up from the airport when I was around 20.  I didn't realize you couldn't stop and wait for people to come out, you have to keep circling.  And I was in her minivan.  So I was parked there waiting and a cop came up to tell me to move and saw, I guess, my jacket and assumed I was military and told me it was OK if I stayed there.

It's funny because I've also had Karens come up to me and tell me I can't wear it because I'm stealing valor or something, a couple of times.  So I tell them my dead brother left it to me when he died in Iraq (a total lie) so I can watch them flounder and sputter and not know what to say.

It's just a jacket to me, a really fuckin' great jacket actually.  But I'm wearing the thing less and less because I feel like I'm taking advantage of peoples' stupidity.  I'm just curious if anyone else has had similar, laughable experiences."
177,punk,punk,"Yea you read that right, I made this song called abi abenteuer, and it's on my album nemna, it's about the corruption and decadency of the german educational system ( i study in a german school) but other songs go around other themes like the increase in sexual harassment in Rio De Janeiro (the song is ""the exposion alligns) anyway here's the link

SEND YOUR BANDS SONGS!!!

We play all genre's of HC and try our best to play as many unsigned bands as possible looking for 

some airplay. If your in a band or know of one, just send a small band bio and .WAV or MP3's to the 

show's e-mail [cjshardcoreandpunk@gmail.com](mailto:cjshardcoreandpunk@gmail.com). All submitted songs are played unless they 

contain any hate related material.

&amp;#x200B;

The other main objective is to show people that there is world filled with like-minded individuals 

making some of the best music on the planet. I grew up in Canada and now live in Scotland, so I 

know UK and North American Hardcore Punk. But i am also an avid music collector and found that 

some of the best HC &amp; Punk comes from countries you may not expect. Come and listen and find 

some new music you never knew existed.

So, I know I'm like forever too late, but I just discovered that hey monday exists.

Found this old poster from the Modern Baseball show that got be back into pop punk at 25 years old. The poster says the show was in Oakland but it was in Berkeley at 924 Gilman. Walter Mitty was the first opener. Poster numbered 4/100. 

This show re kindled my love of pop punk and going to small shows and getting into push pits. If I hadn't gone to this show I don't think I'd be who I am now and definitely would have missed out on some amazing shows since then. 

Anyone else have a special show that rekindled their love of the genre?"

2273,poppunkers,poppunkers,"What are some bands that you feel never truly topped their debut album in terms of quality? For me, a band that i think qualifies is State Champs. A lot of the songs off of ""The Finer Things"" are just pure bliss, as they just knew how to mix energy, angst, and beauty in everything. Then with ATWAB, they lightened up a bit, but still made a catchy album. But the tipping point was Living Proof, as it was just more of the same things we got on the last album. And they've been doing that for years now."

I am a transgender woman who is just now finding herself at 28, thanks to the joys of disassociation. I stumbled upon Against Me a little bit ago and it is like my world opened up. The message of the punk community really resonates with me and the struggles I have had, and I am having a lot of fun diving into this beautiful expression/mentality. However, there is soo much to explore that I feel like I am just floundering about at times. I was hoping some of you might have some recommendations on bands to explore that are musically similar to Against Me, or at least vocally similar to Laura Jane Grace. I would also love any suggestions on what other venues there are for me to get more involved in the punk world in during this Covid influenced world. 

Thank you ahead of time for you replies!"

Mr. P of [Call in Dead](https://www.facebook.com/Callindeadofficial/) here. It would take more than both my hands to count the names of the people I have lost from suicide and/or some form of substance abuse brought on by mental health issues. I used to think this was just a natural part of being a musician, but as I‚Äôve reached middle age, I realize that it‚Äôs not relegated to any one type of person, culture or subculture, it‚Äôs just part of humanity. Perhaps musicians are just more inclined to be vocal about it, ‚Äúwear it on their sleeve‚Äù or have it literally tattooed on them. On one level this has been a great way for me to release and understand my own inner struggles because I‚Äôm around people and bands that can empathize with the pain I‚Äôve felt, but on the other hand, it has always made me less willing to share since the reaction tended to be yeah‚Ä¶you‚Äôre having a rough time‚Ä¶look around, we‚Äòve all had a rough time that‚Äôs why we play in hardcore punk bands. After a year with far too many deaths and far too much grief for me to shake off, I‚Äôve started going to a grief counselor once a week. Some days I wonder why I go, and other days, I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for the outlet. I don‚Äôt discuss it much because it isn‚Äôt something people want to hear about when they ask you ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù Nonetheless, it has kept me even and allowed me to be the best person I can be for those that I care about.

Nobody would look at you twice for going to the gym to get in better physical shape (Unless you are one of those people that needs to mention Cross Fit or Orange Theory every five minutes---cough, cough), but nobody feels as comfortable to mention that they are taking care of their mental or emotional health. The stigma of mental health is one of the worst parts of mental health. People at every job I‚Äôve ever had joke about a ‚Äúmental health day‚Äù as if it‚Äôs not real, as if needing a day to get your mind and emotions in order isn‚Äôt valid. Why not? Isn‚Äôt your mental/emotional health as important as your physical health? I see over a hundred students every day, and it should go without saying that me being aware of and sensitive to their emotional health and well-being helps me create a better bond and be a better teacher. To paraphrase the wisdom of the Internet, ‚ÄúYou might have no visible symptoms, no runny nose, just a head full of darkness. No fever nor rash. No fractures nor sprains. Just a longing for something that you don‚Äôt know how to explain.‚Äù Just because it can‚Äôt be measured with a thermometer or covered with a bandage, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not real. What happens when your mental health fails? What happens when the stigma of mental health prevents you from getting professional help or even sharing with friends and family?

Far too many times in my life, I have seen mental health lead to suicide, and I want to make it clear that people who commit suicide aren‚Äôt ‚Äúselfish‚Äù, and they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúgive up‚Äù; they‚Äôve lost a battle to a disease that is as real and painful and deadly as cancer. Depression is an illness, and people who suffer from it should not be looked down upon as weak any more than someone who has died from a life-threatening physical illness. Your mind is part of your body; we need to stop acting like it‚Äôs not allowed to be sick.

My life is good in more ways that I can possibly count, and I am lucky for all the love and support that I have in my life, but even when you have everything, depression can make you feel like you have nothing, so we need to be there for each other. So in times like now where social distancing has separated us from the vital human contact that has kept so many of us afloat, please know that I am here for you, we are here for you, organizations like MHACF are here for you, so please reach out to them and let them know you need help. There is no shame in asking for help because you will only get love in return. Be strong, be safe, be vocal and wake up each day knowing that you have awakened to victory because you beat the illness within for another day.

Oh and here is the point of this unusually personal message:

We are donating all sales of Call in Dead merch and song sales from Bandcamp downloads including new limited edition CID masks to Mental Health Association of Central Florida. Not only will we donate all sales (Shipping fees have been waived), we will also match the first $200. We‚Äôre also offering a $20 Mental Health Month bundle that includes the following: F@#$%&amp; Suicide bracelets, the face mask, a t-shirt, a beer koozie and a CD w/digital download. If for some reason you don‚Äôt need any merch (Maybe you have a spouse/partner like mine who gets angry at how many band t-shirts you own.), you can just do a direct donation to the MHACF right here on this Facebook post. That‚Äôs more than fine with us. The merch is our way of saying thank you for supporting a good cause, if you don‚Äôt‚Äô want it, but you want to give money to a worthy cause‚Ä¶um yes please. üì∑:)

It‚Äôs okay to not be okay, it‚Äôs okay to hurt, and it‚Äôs even more okay to admit you‚Äôre not okay and hurting and to ask for help.

Please donate, please share, and please be there for each other.

P.S.

Since writing the rough draft of this post, we have reached $505 in direct donations and over $300 in [Bandcamp](https://callindeadfl.bandcamp.com/merch/mental-health-month-bundle-call-in-dead-mask-t-shirt-cd-beer-koozie-and-f-suicide-bracelet) sales, so our current amount that we have raised is over $1,000! I am stunned and awed by your generosity! I‚Äôm also asking you to keep it going because May is not over, and I want to end this as strongly as it began.

Much love!

Sorry if posting this here violates any rules, but I thought this could be of interest to a decent amount of people here.

This subreddit is a place to share and discuss all that music, as well as other subjects related to punk subcultures and Canada! From the classic bands like the Forgotten Rebels and Viletones to new, upcoming artists who want a place to share their music and get it a platform.

I've gotta admit that I also have a bit of an ulterior motive in starting this subreddit: a lot of Canadian punk from the 1970s can be pretty difficult to find. I was born long after that era and recently I've been trying to track a lot of it down, but seminal albums and singles that have been out of print for years, and beyond the few that show up in some deep corner of YouTube every now and then, seem pretty much impossible to listen to. For example, the Curse was a massively influential band to Canada's first wave punk scene, and yet after months of searching I've only been able to find two of their songs online... and I know for a fact that more was recorded! So if you have any rare stuff, please share it here! It would also be cool if the subreddit eventually became a place to organize efforts to track down that sort of stuff, although I realize that's pretty ambitious for a new subreddit about a niche scene.

Anyways I'm done rambling, please check out the subreddit if you're interested! Since it's a new thing too, I'd also like to hear any suggestions for what could be done over there to make using it more enjoyable. Cheers!"

Punk rock has been thriving in the underground for decades and will outlive all of us. If it‚Äôs taught us anything, it‚Äôs that we need to fight for what‚Äôs right.

I've found that many of the major label bands that are generally considered by non-punks to be important punk bands like The Ramones or Sex Pistols, have their status as punks questioned on here in large part due to the fact that they were very commercial major label bands

I personally don't think it completely invalidates a band's status as punk - of course their prominent status attracted derision from bands like Crass, but I still really think The Clash are a worthwhile band, and undeniably punk in sound, on occasion even surpassing Crass when it came to delivering a political message in an interesting musical way.

Obviously though there is something pretty hypocritical about claiming to be combatting systems of power when you're part of a billion pound corporation, so what do you think? Does being part of a major label instantly make you not a punk regardless of anything else?"
2325,poppunkers,poppunkers,"In honor of the two year anniversary a few days ago, I‚Äôm curious to gain the consensus on this album two years down the road now that we‚Äôve had awhile to digest it?

I‚Äôll admit I was unashamedly on board from the get-go. I felt that many songs had Alex Gaskarth‚Äôs fingerprints on them, which naturally clicked with me (still love ATL, Wake Up Sunshine is an incredible return to form). 
 
I will say, I think the deep cuts and non-singles on Living Proof have aged incredibly. I find myself returning to Cut Through the Static, Something About You, The Fix Up, and Criminal (up there for me as a top 5 Champs song) regularly.

1571,punk,punk,"Hello /r/punk,  this is a tutorial for non-American Spotify users on how to stream some of Rollins Band's music that may not be available in your region (as well as some other potential bands). 

As a Russian living in Canada, I was really frustrated that I couldn't find anything but a few stand up albums and a song from a movie soundtrack on Spotify, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.

This will be a slightly complicated process, since what you will basically be doing is spoofing your location through an American debit card and address. For this you will need the following:

* **A Transferwise Account (free)** (or an American friend/relative)
* **NordVPN (paid)** (or an American friend/relative) 
* **A Paypal account**
* An existing **Spotify** account is recommended, since you may be able to save money

Essentially, what Transferwise can do for you is create a USD account with a designated debit card and bank account information. The card itself is free (and delivery too), but the catch is that you need to add $20 onto it. The card will then be mailed to your actual residential address (doesn't need to be in the US).

After topping up the account and getting the card, you can turn on NordVPN and set your location to the US. Go to PayPal.com and create an account with your newly obtained debit card. You can use the address of the bank that was provided to you on transferwise. Congratulations, now you have an American PayPal account.

The final step is to log into your Spotify account and change your country. You can do so by going to you account page, then to available plans, then select ANY plan as if you want to switch to it. But instead of going through with it, simply press ""update payment"". You will be taken to a page where you can change your country. Choose the US and just use PayPal (with your American card and address) as the payment option. After that you should be able to get the premium spotify. In my case I even managed to keep my student discount.

Again, this might be too complicated just for being able to stream some exclusive music, but I noticed that Eric Johnson's Ah Via Musicom is also available. Let me know if you run into any problems or have any questions."
3114,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place for this but I was hoping if someone could tell me if they have Stovall or Much Love on vinyl at their table on this tour. I‚Äôve been trying to pick up Stovall for a while now, but recently it‚Äôs been listed at $200 or above and I just can‚Äôt do that. Much Love is cheaper but I‚Äôd  prefer to give that to the band and not a third party."

So today Dillinger Four put up the last triple rock show on Bandcamp.

Also OWTH put up a live set.

The same irony when ""my first mohawk"" and ""my new Nazi stompers"" posts are the daily trend.

These vanity posts get followed by more vanity posts. And if not vanity then what is it? This is a place called /r/punk, it is inherent what music is listened to by the community.

1168,punk,punk,"This is a thought I had recently due to the rising statement often times heard in certain circles. The statement ""conservative is the new punk"". When I had first heard it I was immediately skeptical. I was never super political but I was always a big fan of general freedom. It was my conservative school that told me I needed to cut my hair (men's hair wasn't allowed to touch their ears), which I of course refused. But the more I thought about it the more I started questioning what makes something punk. Now the reason people think that conservative is the new punk is pretty obvious. Regardless of your views you'd have to be willingly ignorant to deny that the western world is getting more left wing. Even Republicans are often championing gay marriage and you hear about gay conservative spokespersons. So one could easily make the connection that being hated would make something punk. But does it really? After all eating babies is hated, beating up old ladies is pretty despised. And when I thought about it, the more I thought about possibly the most controversial figure in punk. Gg allin. A man so hated and reviled that he was banned from venues constantly. But he, under everything he did, had a point. He was pro freedom. On the flip side of this we have the band rise against. A progressive and vegan band that plays more shows in a week than most will play in their lives, a band that has brand deals, and is probably the only band that has ""acceptable"" radio songs. So who's more punk? I guess my question is really what makes something punk. Being hated by a large group of people, or making a certain sound that has the traditional speed and anger. I don't know, what do you guys think?"

3453,poppunkers,poppunkers,"TL;DR This is my rant about the fanbases that come from the Scene.

People say that Kpop fans are some of the worst. I'd agree, but Scene fans aren't too far behind in my opinion. I'm talking about the fanbases of bands such as All Time Low, Waterparks, and the ""Emo Trinity"". They almost dedicate their whole lives to their favorite bands and possibly even swear to defend their precious babies. These people say they're fine with constructive criticism, but when something sounds pretty harsh, they just say you're there to hate and don't even want to hear you out. They don't even consider casual listener type fans to be real fans. One time I was talking to one on YouTube about the ATL panda teaser video and why I'm not a fan of Last Young Renegade. He boasted at one point how he got to meet the band on MULTIPLE occasions and has been to several concerts. He said he was told about the the making of the album and how they went into the desert or something to write the album. He even said the band doesn't really care about chart success because they care more about their fans, which I didn't really believe too much because bands to some degree have to care. Reading everything he wrote honest gave me a headache because it made me feel like he thought because he was so familiar with the band that he was superior in some ways. It honestly makes my blood boil having to read all these obsessive things to the point where I start to hate the band. Does anyone feel the same way?"
2429,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Last year singer, rapper Machine Gun Kelly revealed that he was working on a rock album, and in december 2019, he clarified that it'll be a pop punk album called ""Tickets To My Downfall"".

One of the main producers of the album will be blink-182 drummer Travis Barker. The album will feature collabs with YUNGBLUD, Trippie Redd, blackbear and Young Thug.

So far he has released 3 pop punk inspired tracks:

1. I Think I'm Okay (with YUNGBLUD and Travis Barker)
2. why are you here
3. Bloddy Valentine

* What do you think about the idea of MGK doing an album on this genre?
* How do think this will affect the pop punk genre? MGK is a way bigger artists than any of the modern pop punk bands, I think that this could bring the genre on the mainstream (at least for a bit). Nostalgia sells, a lot people while listening to the record could go ""WOW! This takes me back to when I was a 2005 kid""
* And what do you think of his recent attempts of a pop punk sound?"

2328,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I've always been a fan of production breakdowns of songs and albums by the band/producer - you get to learn a lot about the songwriting process, why specific arrangements were used, and some production tricks you may not hear otherwise.

A mainstream example of this would be Rick Beato's ""What Makes This Song Great"" series, but it's harder to come by analysis like this for pop punk compositions.

I was so excited to learn All Time Low released a 3:30 hour track-by-track review of Wake Up, Sunshine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAceAZKBJVM). It was so interesting to hear different elements soloed out and discussed. 

My question is, is anybody aware of similar reviews in the genre? Would be awesome to see a breakdown of some of the newer State Champs releases for example. Thanks."
357,punk,punk,"So, long story short, I've lived in Detroit my whole life and I'm a big punk and hardcore fan. I've never really had the time (working nights fucked that up for me) or ability to get out and support my local scene, but the pandemic really made me realize how important it is to do so. So when it's safe to go out in groups again I want to get out to punk venues and support local bands. But I need help, so are there any venues that you guys can reccomend to me and any bands from Detroit, or the Midwest in general. I really appreciate any responses and I'm ready get out there with you guys when it's all safe. Thanks"
1369,punk,punk,"First off, I'm pretty new to Reddit and I've only stalked this subreddit for a little bit so sorry if I'm asking dumb questions and please don't yell at me. 

But, as the title says, I'm scared to start trying to go to shows once quarantines over because I don't have friends to go with and I really don't fit the part. I read on here that there's not like a specific look you have to fit but I feel like I'm pretty far from it. I'm a 21F college student in a sorority and as appearances go, I look like a sorority girl. If you've seen any sorority recruitment videos, [like this one](https://youtu.be/03vs6-hUEwQ), that's pretty much what my friends and I look like. I'm worried people won't take me seriously or be very friendly if I try and get deeper into the punk scene (is that what its called? idk sorry). 

When I wear shirts with bands I like on my campus, people always assume I bought it at Urban Outfitters or quiz me on super-specific trivia. (like I like the music but I don't know the serial number of the drummer's car)

 I think I'm mostly worried about going to punk shows alone and not making any friends because I look like a poser? Is there any way to meet people that I can go to shows with or should I just go to a show and hope I can meet people there?"

Hey Friends!

I'm an audio engineer based in Central NJ. Would love to help out some bands navigating home recording for the first time, or just looking to take their sound to the next level and set them up for success with a great mix or master! I've worked pretty extensively out here with the NJ scene, but want to make friends across the globe and hear how Pop Punk takes shape in different demographics. Super affordable flat rates for mixes, along with a free test mix or master for anyone whose interested! Just looking to give back to a genre that's meant so much to me!

I've worked with; Transfer Post, LOVEONACID (ex. Save Face), Groomers, and Floral Guilt just to name a few! Would love to add your band to list and help ya make something memorable and meaningful :).

I won't link directly to my website because I'm not sure if that's allowed, but if you're interested in hearing some work, just lemme know and I'll link ya some stuff!

1484,punk,punk,"I have a few ideas but really don‚Äôt get it. 

1) they‚Äôre dorky and lame, ugly, not charming. compounded with being musically very good, it triggers hate from fashion victims.
2) emo hate.  they‚Äôre the most visible and popular emo band, which a lot of people don‚Äôt like.
3) in the punk community, a legitimate rejection of their social status.

I‚Äôm not a super fan of them and don‚Äôt care enough about them to see them live.  At best I‚Äôm a casual fan that listens to a few dozen tracks.  Even though I don‚Äôt listen to them often, I appreciate their exceptional songwriting craftsmanship, Armstrong has a great rock voice, catchy hooks, tight band, etc. and have an unique identifiable sound. The drumming kind of sucks tho, which gets on my nerves cause it could be one of their goods like ‚ÄúAmerican Idiot‚Äù and all of a sudden you hear this shitty crash which distracts me from enjoying it."

145,punk,punk,"Hello punk people,

My name is Tara and I'm from the bay area in Cali. I wouldn't say that I'm ""punk"" BUT I've always kind of liked it. My first taste in punk goes back to when I was 16 and I watched the movie 'Control' about Joy Division and I thought that it was really good for an indie film. I then decided well what the heck, I'll listen to Joy Division and actually found that I like their music and did research on the singer Ian Curtis. I read that he was inspired/really liked Lou Reed, David Bowie, and Iggy &amp; The Stooges. I decided to check them all out and grew to love all of them especially The Stooges and their album, 'Funhouse' and that went from The Stooges to Black Flag and that's actually pretty much it lol BUT that's why I'm here...to get more knowledge and punkness from here. I just wanted to say hello and to introduce myself and my young punkness for now."

744,punk,punk,"I've recently been thinking about how many abusers seem to get popular in the punk, pop punk, and emo scenes. It's had me upset, since a lot of the music is good yet I don't want to support the people. 

So I was wondering if this has been done yet. I had an idea of a compilation album of a bunch of rising punk and alt bands covering songs made by abusers to give the music a new image and reclaim it. It's a way of bringing back the ideals of being punk and revamping the music. If this has been done, I would love to check it out.

If not, I would be very interested in helping organize an album like it!"
3223,punk,poppunkers,"Yesterday, I posted my debut single, Disregard, and I got so much more love from you all than I ever expected. It was absolutely overwhelming. As someone who is just doing this himself, hasn't played a show yet, and is just trying to get my name out there, the amount of support I received yesterday was an absolute game-changer for my mindset and the expectations that I've put upon myself. I will take this opportunity and use it as a way of thanking you by saying that I will do my absolute best to make my EP as good as it can possibly sound. I'd love to get to know you all, so feel free to send me a chat, ask questions, or anything of that nature. I got nearly **500** plays yesterday upon release on my first tune and that was largely in part to your efforts. I know that isn't a lot compared to more established artists, but that's a lot for a nobody like me. Who knows, maybe some day soon I'll hit get past that dreaded 'Under 1,000 plays' mark on my page on Spotify sooner than I expected. Maybe one day I'll be playing a show and get to meet one of you in person. Maybe one day I'll be on the banner for this subreddit. I wasn't sure if it was at all possible before, but the support y'all gave me yesterday really instills that sense of hope in me.

Thank you so much."

136,poppunkers,punk,"So, some background info: before COVID hit I (28M) started a punk band; we started practicing in like the last week of January and had to stop mid-March. I do lead vocals and guitar and am the principle songwriter. Since the pandemic hit I‚Äôve only been able to meet with my drummer once and otherwise have just been writing and practicing at home. It‚Äôs a tough time for all of us and I‚Äôm honestly not sure where we stand on if or when we can go back to practicing as a group. 

BUT I now have a bunch of songs with nowhere to play them and l always intended to eventually find a lead guitarist - I‚Äôm much more of a rhythm guitarist and a singer/songwriter myself and while I can and do practice my instrument I feel I could easily find a better lead player than myself. I also hoped to find a second guitarist because I would love to collaborate on songwriting and be able to get some constructive criticism on my songs. It‚Äôs bringing me down that I want to work on music but there‚Äôs only so much I can do by myself. Anyone else feel the same way and want to try to collaborate? Most of the songs sound kind of like early-mid 90s pop punk and my biggest influences are probably that and the more melodic side of 80s hardcore punk. However, I listen to all kinds of punk and punk-adjacent music and have been having fun experimenting with different styles and influences."

I have come to realize that the reason i long for those times were because of the vibrate communitys that were happening from CBGBS to even just the swirlies playing in someones basement. I am looking for a place were people are open minded , i should also tell you guys that even though this is going on the punk subreddit or whatever this is, ideal im just looking for a place with the ‚Äúpunk‚Äù mindset and comunity. Also if the Arts community is working thats always great, seeing that the art scene and the ‚Äúpunk‚Äù scene are in the same boat. To me the music scene will come naturally if the community is right. bands i like Swirlies, My Bloody Valentine, Throbbing Grisle, The cramps, Slowdive, (i know most of these bands arent really ‚Äúpunk‚Äù but really whats more punk than pushing the boundery or music) Television... u probably get it. if they use a jazzmaster and are pre 2010s thats my scene.

The Jimmy Heartburn show is like listening to the history of punk. I got him started in becoming a punnk fan and collector in Vancouver Canada. IHe was good friends with my 3 sons and when I would give them rides to everything they did I had cd's of a lot of punk like the pistols. I loved it and early metallica and you name it, I had it  The dolls etc.Even early rap, and I was raising 10 kids at the same time but he was around so much he was just another addon number 11. The music brought him in.

 He became one of the top collectors of punk and he himself is a library of punk. Every show is packed everything from obscure to well known. Check it out. If u are a true punk music fan this show is a must"

The Upsides by The Wonder Years turned 10 years old today. I'll never forget hearing them for the first time on last.fm in my room. After my friends stopped playing video games so much, my xbox became used almost exclusively for music and last.fm. I remember this is how I learned about bands like Such Gold, Four Year Strong, Icallfives, and countless other pop punk bands. 

The Wonder Years always stood out to me though. Their lyrics were so much more ""real"" and personal. I remember when I ordered the Upsides physical copy and I read the letter the left to fans on the inside cover. 

From high school, throughout college, and now in law school this album has always been with me. If I never heard this album I never would have wanted to be in a band or tour. And never would have met so many great people from getting involved in music. I owe a lot of that motivation to this album. 

So anyway, happy 10 year anniversary to this gem of a record. Its still so perfect in so many ways. I'll always love this album.

88,punk,punk,"As someone who has grown up in the British punk scene and in the British working class community, the Sex Pistols have been a huge influence. And while they are not my favourite band, Never Mind The Bollocks is one of the best albums in my opinion. I see many people on this thread though trashing them, calling them fake and manufactured blah blah blah. Now I'm don't want to come off as brown nosing the band, but a few points must be made. This might seem a bit long but here we go. 

**Where the Sex Pistols the first punks?**

Fuck No! No matter what Lydon claims the CBGB scene in the US kicked off long before and we had proto Punk before that. 

**Where the Sex Pistols influential?**

Arguably they are probably the most influential Punk band. The kick started the UK scene (The Damned did release the first uk punk single but the Pistols were playing before them). Bands such Joy Division and The Smiths  to Black Flag and to RATM to Nirvana to plenty of bands have cited them as an influence. What makes the Sex Pistols great is that were influential to many non punk acts and punk acts. So many artists have said once they heard the pistols they wanted to pick up an instrument immediately. 

**Is Lydon a cunt?**

Yes, he always has been. 

**Are they the best?**

Subjective. 

**Do you have to like the Sex Pistols to be punk?**

Fuck no. Like what you want.

**""The Sex Pistols are a manufactured boy band""**

Complicated. Steven Jones and Paul Cook approached McLaren first and got Matlock and Rotten in the band later. McLaren manipulated the band and certainly organised stunts and shit to increase their notoriety. But the attitude of the members was not fake. They were English working class lads. McLaren lies and claims that he is responsible for most of the shit, such as the Bill Grundy interview, but it has been debunked by not just the Pistols but many others who were in the scene. McLaren was known for chatting shit and claiming responsibility. Yes he had influence and control over the band. But they wrote their own music, played their instruments and had authentic attitudes. Not like the manufactured boy bands where everything is decided in a board room. The reason the band ended is literally because of McLaren. 

**The fashion** 

I can see why people get mad about the fashion craze. But the style was not created by McLaren or Westwood. The style came from the English working class culture, people would wear safety pins for example as a sign of poverty. McLaren and Westwood exploiting the image to make money. 

**JUST DON'T TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY**

People seem to forget they were just a bunch of working class teenagers, growing up in a time when social issues where at all time high in the UK. They were taking the piss most of the time. The band themselves were only getting paid around ¬£20 a week at their height of popularity.

**So I never understood why attack the band? Yes Lydon is a cunt. But attack the people at the top who were exploiting a bunch of working class kids and turned their culture into a fashion craze to make money.**"

He‚Äôs basically a conservative political commentator but he also does videos about punk music on the side since he used to be heavy into the scene and claims he still is.

 (https://youtu.be/nOOSmyxNE3s) but here‚Äôs the summary.

Basically, He picks apart a video by AJ+ that talks about the roles of black peoples in Punk music. He basically says that Bad Brains and Death have no part in the discussion of the history of punk due to the fact that they weren‚Äôt that big and had little to none influence on the culture and music and that people only mention them because they are black. He also states that both Bad Brains and Death are kinda posers In a sense because he claims they were both glam/ funk bands and then hopped onto punk when it became popular.

He also talks about his opinion on ‚ÄúAfro Punk‚Äù and that it‚Äôs not real punk because they are injecting racial identity politics into punk when the whole idea of punk is to *not do that. That punk was for everyone who wasn‚Äôt a normie or jock. Punk was about no rules or barriers and stuff. 

Can people who know a ton about the history of punk say how right/wrong he is? Or what‚Äôs your opinion just in general about this."
1497,punk,punk,"Maybe not in the traditional sense. Maybe there was something unique that occurred or something surrounding the show itself that made it the most memorable. 

I've been fortunate enough to have seen a lot of awesome shows, but there is one that commonly sticks out to me. Around 2005 or 2006 A Global Threat was on this weird package tour with Bane, Strike Anywhere and what seemed like 3 - 4 other hardcore bands. This is relevant because in my mind the show lasted for what seemed like 5 hours. I also remember thinking it was weird AGT was touring with all these hardcore bands. Anyway...lets say AGT was supposed to play 5th out of 7, but all night every band kept saying they were having car troubles but were on the way. Bane got done playing and said AGT were almost there. Then Strike Anywhere played and told everyone to stay for AGT, they were almost there. All the hardcore kids left and there was a group of maybe 15 of us waiting around for AGT. 

Every other band had left except for Strike Anywhere and I think the bass player for Bane and the venue was trying to get everyone outside. Finally, maybe an hour after Strike Anywhere played AGT shows up just looking exhausted and defeated. I guess their van broke down so one guy had to walk to a uhaul, rent a van, pick up the band and equipment from the first van and then get to the show as fast as they could...before the uhaul van blew a tire. Just problem after problem. So they get there and try to set up but the venue is telling them its getting close to curfew and they want to call it a night. TO THIS GUYS CREDIT, I remember the singer from Strike Anywhere pleading with the venue to let AGT play after everything they'd been through. The venue wasn't stoked but let them set up and play a stripped down set then cut off all the mics to the drums and amps halfway through their 20 minute set. Then finally cut the vocal mic during the last song.

When I say this, I mean it in the most honest, respectful way possible. For those 20 minutes me and a handful of kids were transported back to 1982 when punk was dangerous. When venues and promoters regularly ripped off bands. AGT could have easily called the show off that night and even I would have understood given the circumstances, but they didn't. We went off for a hard 20 minutes, they deserved what we gave them. I don't even remember them selling merch that night because they probably didn't even have it with them. After their set, Brian sat down and talked to us for maybe 15 minutes before they loaded up and left. 

That night has stayed in my mind for a long time."

My favorite song was called ""hunting for the bikini spider"" or something of that nature, it was basically an ode to unruly pubic hair. The chorus said "" I've been hunting for the elusive bikini spider""

I haven't been able to find any information on it and it might have just been some local or near local band. Just had to put this out there on the slight chance that someone else remembers this band or song or possibly even some of their music."

The aesthetic of the movie is so great, and the soundtrack superb. I love the dead Kennedys so kill the poor was nice to hear, but 'i love living in the city' and 'sex and violence' were also amazing additions to the ST. and those last few scenes were so great and powerful honestly.

Menzingers sound like a lot of other 90s and 2000s bands

Even in the EP and Stovall era I would argue their releases were of equal or better quality than a ton of the genre in 2014/2015.

Looking to hear what other people think of them, because I feel like this is an unpopular opinion."
2140,poppunkers,poppunkers,"
I feel like I have a very skewed perception of it. As a teenage emo fan, obviously I would perceive emo/screamo/post-hardcore/pop-Punk/etc as being everywhere. 

As a 30-year-old, I perceive it as being nowhere except for the ‚Äúold‚Äù jams I used to listen to. 

The only thing I know about what ‚Äúkids these days‚Äù listen to is just a bunch of one-hit-wonder hip-hop

Anyone else have any insight?"

The Ramones, Old Chicago, October 20th, 1979

One of the best shows I have ever seen was also my first punk show. The Ramones.

My girlfriend and I saw in the paper that The Ramones were playing at Old Chicago. This was 1979. At that time I think The Ramones must have been my favorite band. It was right about the time Road To Ruin came out.

Old Chicago was an odd place for The Ramones to play. West of Chicago, it was a shopping mall that had, I recall, a large dome in the middle which housed an indoor amusement park - roller coaster, ferris wheel, the works. That way you could go shopping and also ride a roller coaster with just one trip. Sounds like whoever built that place was on a ‚Äúmanic high‚Äù and had a good line of credit! Needless to say it wasn‚Äôt very successful. I think the place started going broke about twenty minutes after it opened. They were getting pretty close to closing for good when they started having concerts. You paid the five dollar admission to the park and the concert was free.

Back in 1979 there weren‚Äôt very many punks in Chicago - but I think every single one of us was at that concert. It was the early days of punk, you know, sunglasses even though it was nighttime, guys walking around with their girlfriends on dawg leashes (and vica versa), lots of safety pins and spiky hair. The amusement park / shopping mall was pretty absurd and it was even more bizarre with all the punks wandering around looking at each other.

There was no opening band. We all stood silently and watched as The Ramones set up their own equipment, plugging in microphones and guitars, setting up amps, flashlights sticking out of the back pockets of their jeans. They were their own roadies.

Then they walked off stage.

One minute later they walked back onstage and all of a sudden they were THE RAMONES!

Joey shouted, ‚ÄúHello Kiddy-land! We‚Äôre the Ramones and this ones called BLITZKRIEG BOP!!!!!!!!!‚Äù (or something like that.)

What happened next was the loudest, fastest, and best hour of music I have ever experienced. When the first song started the entire crowd jumped up and stood on the chairs. It seems like they played about fifty songs in sixty minutes, Joey shouting out the titles as they sped through the set. It was the best show I‚Äôd ever seen.

Since it was a free concert included in the price of admission to the amusement park there were a number of older people and families at the show - non-punk people who were actually there for the cheesy rides. Most of them left after the first minute; but some of the older people (that is to say: people who were about what my age is now!) actually jumped up on their chairs and stayed for the entire show.

After the show a guy came out with a big trunk. He opened it and started selling its contents: Ramones T-shirts. There was a feeding frenzy and they sold out in about ten minutes. I bought one and for years it was my favorite T-shirt. But it wasn‚Äôt very thick material and over the years it eventually just disintegrated.

Somebody has a website where they list setlists from all know Ramones concerts; but they didn‚Äôt have this show. But looks like all their concerts in late 1979 had pretty much the same setlist - so here‚Äôs one that should work:

Blitzkrieg Bop / Teenage Lobotomy / Rockaway Beach / I Don't Want You / Go Mental / Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment / Rock 'N' Roll High School / I Wanna Be Sedated / I Just Want To Have Something To Do / She's The One / I'm Against It / Sheena Is A Punk Rocker / Havana Affair / Commando / Needles And Pins / I Want You Around / Surfin' Bird / Cretin Hop / All The Way / Judy Is A Punk / California Sun / I Don't Wanna Walk Around With You / Today Your Love, Tomorrow The World / Pinhead / Do You Wanna Dance? / Suzy Is A Headbanger / Lets Dance / Chinese Rock / Beat On The Brat / We're A Happy Family / Bad Brain / I Wanted Everything"
2759,poppunkers,poppunkers,My friend showed me Adornment by Grayscale and I'm obsessed and in love. My main listening consists of metal/deathcore and active rock. I think it's something about the vocalist's voice that I love even more. Can anybody recommend some other bands like Grayscale?

2418,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Big TSSF fan here and am absolutely loving the Same aside EP that just came out. Love the production on it, the songs are gorgeous and it has a lovely vibe to it. I‚Äôve never really listened to  Elder Brother so I put them on and was surprised to hear they‚Äôre quite different from Same Side. I couldn‚Äôt really get into it but am going to listen again.

Anyone else feeling the Same Side EP and any specific Elder Brother tracks to check out as an entry point? Hope we get a Same Side full length!"

754,punk,punk,"I think the proper starting point for should be earlier than 1976.

1975 it was already there and starting to get big, 1974 it was firmly established, 1973 it was the proper start 

Sex Pistols were gigging in 1975, countless bands are everywhere. 1st issue of Punk magazine is released.

Richard Hell, Blondie and The Ramones were performing at CBGBs in 1974. The basic look and aesthetic is firmly established. 

In 1973 Blast, The Punks, and Death and countless others ( Dictators, Dolls) already had a good amount of that 1977 sound and even proto hardcore sound .The style and sound is somewhat clear, in a early sense, and the word punk is used to some degree."

I fucking hate anti nowhere league, I don‚Äôt really know why. Something about the guy that sings... idk. The thing is that I fucking hate to like this song.

If you remember the Ferguson Protests them you might have seen some pretty impactful photos from them.  Well, a lot of those people wound up missing or dead.

Cops and white supremacists have been known dox, arrest, and even murder the people identified in protest photos.  

I'm not sure if this is something that belongs on this sub (mods?) but I couldn't just not share this information.

And if you're going to protests, stay safe and make sure you're unidentifiable!"

1806,punk,punk,"I saw someone mention Blink 182 in a post below and they referred to them as a ""gateway band""

I was thinking about this very thing the other day, but could not articulate it as such on my own.  Some people are lucky enough to have crusty parents that introduced them to punk at an early age; I am not one of those people.  I was raised on NOTHING but country my whole life until I started figuring out my own tastes and finally getting access to the internet.

So I was thinking, what are some of yall's gateway bands?  Is anyone brave enough to be uncool and admit what they were?  I'll go first:

I started listening to 311, Sublime, and Bob Marley in High school.  I also remember hearing the Stone Temple Pilots on the radio and my ears perked up.  This started me on Disturbed, and a whole bunch of other shitrock bands that I don't really remember.  I started dating a punk loving dude when I was 18, and he made me a mix CD, introducing me to The Misfits and Black Flag.  The rest, as they say, is History."
2697,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Do you guys have any idea which song this could be? It was entirely pick up lines.

Also got The Finer Things from pure noise...also skipped.  Ordered two of the Real Friends albums from fearless...skipped.  but anything from Hopeless Records has been fantastic. Curious if anyone has had similar experiences because my family got me a few new records for my birthday that haven't arrived yet and I'm sooo nervous they're going to skip. :(  What are the best record companys to buy from?
3309,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Anyone in NYC going to The Wonder Years are Webster Hall this Saturday? I'm super excited because this will me by fourth time, but I'm also apprehensive because I'm physically disabled and Webster Hall has shitty seating. I'm claiming one for the openers and some of the slow songs so that I have energy to mosh later. 
Anyone wanna hang out with me?"
1380,punk,punk,"So with everything happening with corona, I have been thinking about the NOFX song ""Just The Flu"" a lot lately. I think there are some valid similarities between that song and the current situation. [Just The Flu-NOFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aGuSUIHMIo) is a link to the song if you want. 

Particularly the lyrics:

""**When the news had spread, that soon we'd all be dead**  
**Well it just blew our minds**  
**No one could have guessed that our worst fears at best**  
**Figments of our time**

**So it seems that our dreams will never come to be**  
**How can such a stupid thing destroy humanity?**  
**A few weeks till extinction and there's nothing we can do**  
**A message sent to other worlds will say ""It was just the flu""**""

At the beginning of all this COVID-19 stuff, everyone was comparing it to the flu. It seems like everyone is in disbelief at the state of things right now, just like in the song! Who knows, maybe we are just a few weeks to extinction...

If thats your sorta thing hit me up and I'll shoot you my discord. Would be cool to have some people to play with who like the same style of music and heck, may even share some similar life values.

**When we cancelled the remainder of our Burst &amp; Decay II tour last week, we said that it caused two immediate problems: (1) some people weren‚Äôt going to get to see the B&amp;D set as we rarely play shows like that and (2) we have a lot of leftover merch that was intended for those remaining gigs. 

So, in an attempt to remedy both, we‚Äôre going to be doing an extended B&amp;D Live Stream with a ton of songs spanning both Burst &amp; Decay EPs and more, multiple cameras and high-definition audio mixed live by our friend and FOH engineer, Andy Clarke. We‚Äôre offering tickets to that in packages with the leftover merch, all of which will be discounted. 

If you had tickets to any of the shows, please, contact your point of purchase for a refund. We saw some people (very kindly) suggest not getting refunds in an attempt to help us out but it won‚Äôt work out like that. Please, go get your refund and if you want to support us (thank you!) buying a ticket/merch bundle to this would be an amazing way to do it. If you have any trouble getting your refund, let us know and we‚Äôll look into it!

The stream will take place on June 5th at 6pm EST (3pm PST, 11pm GMT, 8am AEST (on June 6th) [We‚Äôre pretty sure that‚Äôs right but maybe double check because daylight savings, etc.]) Ticket packages will be available Monday May 11th on thewonderyears.myshopify.com**"

 I would say The Wonder Years personally,  since they're lyrics are quite mature (im 22, still wouldnt say that most of the stuff is super relatable to me yet despite being crazy well written)"

Fall Out Boy - Take This To Your Grave
Fall Out Boy -  From Under The Cork Tree
Green Day - American Idiot
Panic! At The Disco - A Fever You Can't Sweat Out

There's a lot of interesting things I found out while reading it. Some highlights of it, such as how the album was recorded, mixed and mastered to the way the band was like during their first professional recordings.   


I'd highly recommend it to anybody who's a fan of the Ramones, early punk rock, and those who are curious to know some stories behind the entire genre's origins."

883,punk,punk,"About last year or so I saw a clip from an interview from the 90s with a guy dressed like a punk musician speaking about his band while he was walking on the side of the road. The clip had Dutch subtitles and the only part I remember was when the interviewer asked him about his choice in women and he replied, ‚Äú I don‚Äôt really have sex anymore, I will on occasion when I really get that feeling in my loins but otherwise I don‚Äôt.‚Äù And ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fuck the girls that I want to fuck but the girls I don‚Äôt want to fuck wanna fuck me.‚Äù

3661,poppunkers,poppunkers,"The Finer Things by State Champs, Under Soil and Dirt by TSSF, Rain in July by Neck Deep. I miss this sound so much.
I love the voice cracks (looking at you, Wonder Years), the emotional screams (what's up, Hot Mulligan), the messy, all over the place mixing that makes it sound so unperfected (Late Nights in My Car by Real Friends).

I'm not bashing all of these bands for doing what they need to do in order to keep their band alive or following wherever their passion for music takes them. I just miss how raw and imperfect it used to sound. I feel like a lot of the albums that our most popular* bands are releasing now sound more and more like something you'd hear on mainstream radio. 

Proper Dose has become one of the most well known and loved albums in the pop punk scene. It's a masterpiece. Composure by Real Friends slaps, and Identity by WSTR is whack (in a good way). All I'm saying is that I would love to hear all of these new, super produced-sounding albums with a 2000 - 2014/15 pop punk sound filter over them.

Like I said, I love all these bands and I love seeing them grow and evolve. But, I find myself getting bored quickly with the new stuff. I listened to Proper Dose for a few weeks, maybe a month before I started skipping any of the songs that came on. I didn't get bored of What You Can't See or Life's Not Out to Get You nearly as quickly. What's a humble pop punker to do? 

TL;DR A lot of the bigger pop punk bands are releasing super produced sounding albums and I miss that raw early 2010's sound


Anyways, love to hear your thoughts about what I've said. Always love to get new band recs, too!"
3659,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Thoughts on Seaway?

Although I‚Äôve really liked pretty much everything Seaway have ever dropped is it just me who is waiting for the band to drop that next level album?

These tracks are often seen as legendary by the punk rock scene, but I can't help but think that if these songs were released today as they were, they would be classified as pop punk.

Even sites like Rolling Stone placed albums by these bands in their list of Greatest Pop Punk Albums of All Time.

602,punk,punk,"I'd like to consider myself a member of the punk community at large, but I never belonged either because I felt I didn't or someone else decided I did not. 

From my experience from clicks, scenes, and communities I've noticed this:

1. You can't have a punk ethos and behave like an 80's hair metal star - turns a lot of people off. I get it-but there are a lot of double standards with this rule. 
2. While the punk scene has always been a progressive accepting community it has become increasingly PC over the years to the point where the philosophies are starting to contradict. This issue is constantly gas lighted by everyone trying to get rid of hate (which we all want trust me) but instead of doing some critical thinking about differences in perspective people are silenced, and entire topics are washed as taboo.  
3. The social politics dominate everything and everyone tip toes around being really nice to each other, and  for the longest time I never understood this- until it was explained that people are doing this because they want something from another person with connections and influence.  I mean I guess everything is subject to this but somehow I expected more from people...
4. Fashion and cultural credibility reign supreme. It does matter how you look, it does matter the kind of trendy shit you like or say, these superficial things this whole movement was trying to get rid of is now commonplace. 

I guess there might have been a decision down the line that we all like the same music and these issues aren't worth debating anymore and I understand that. It makes me sad to think that this has become a sub-culture just as superficial as everything else it was supposed to set itself apart from. 

Anyone else see it this way?"
