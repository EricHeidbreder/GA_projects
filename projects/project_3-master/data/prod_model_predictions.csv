Shouldn't that be a good thing knowing America at one point was an Anti Fascist country during WWII? We all should know Fascism was a complete failure so why are conservatives seeing ANTIFA as a terrorist organization?"
2420,poppunkers,poppunkers,"My fianc√© and I are getting MARRIED on October 3rd (pending restrictions being lifted in our state on group gatherings), and I'm starting to work on the playlist for our DJ. Our first dance song is ""You Had Me At Hello"" by A Day to Remember because the day we met he gave me the aux cable and asked me to pick something from his phone and I freaked out when I saw he liked ADTR and basically it was love at first playlist.

SO I'm having a hard time picking a song for the father/daughter dance. My dad likes stuff like Five Finger Death Punch and Godsmack (facepalm) which is not making it any easier since many of the typical songs are country or pop, which neither of us is really a huge fan of. Any songs you can think of that have a dad/daughter vibe?? 

The only one that comes to mind is Sweet Child O Mine by Guns n' Roses, which would be neat because I learned how to play that song on guitar when my dad took me to lessons as a teenager, but doesn't quite fit the bill. Doesn't have to be a slow song, I'm just looking for more of a rock/pop punk/post hardcore song rather than classic rock or country/pop and I'm drawing a huge blank."

We play all genre's of HC and try our best to play as many unsigned bands as possible looking for 

some airplay. If your in a band or know of one, just send a small band bio and .WAV or MP3's to the 

show's e-mail [cjshardcoreandpunk@gmail.com](mailto:cjshardcoreandpunk@gmail.com). All submitted songs are played unless they 

contain any hate related material.

The other main objective is to show people that there is world filled with like-minded individuals 

making some of the best music on the planet. I grew up in Canada and now live in Scotland, so I 

know UK and North American Hardcore Punk. But i am also an avid music collector and found that 

some of the best HC &amp; Punk comes from countries you may not expect. Come and listen and find 

some new music you never knew existed.

If your looking for a hardcore &amp; punk radio show that takes nothing for granted, supports the 

smaller bands getting airplay, then join us for some kick-ass music from around the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Peace Everybody. CJ"

Bad brains and some songs by Dead Kennedys &amp; Black Flag are the kind of hardcore I like- if it‚Äôs hardcore, I like the stuff that‚Äôs more riff-based than lofi yelling. Pop punk is a touchy subject here, I actually kinda hate a lot of it- the Tom DeLonge vocal style ruins it for me. I am a massive Green Day fan though (please don‚Äôt hate me). Basically I like the punk that‚Äôs more early CBGB/poppy garage rock than hardcore. 

What are some bands I might like? Recently saw the Adicts, they‚Äôre awesome."

I love being able to scroll through the new posts to check out new and upcoming artists who are contributing to the pop punk zeitgeist in refreshing and inspiring ways, it just energizes me. But I swear every single time these new artists who are genuinely talented are never listened to or upvoted for others to see because there will always be someone posting some The Story So Far song, or some throwback to MCR or Fall Out Boy (and don't get me wrong, I love them too). 

I guess this is just a friendly reminder to step outside of your comfort zone in this community and see what new music is out there for us all to enjoy. I feel like we like pop punk because of the genuine raw emotion, angst, and clarity it can convey. And the depth of those feelings can't all be expressed by the same popular artists that are upvoted so intensely time and time again. So I'm going to try harder to check out what you all are posting in the new section, and giving all those artists you come across the time they deserve to be heard.

I have a handful of splits I have gotten from shows over the years, but other than that just a bunch of dad rock LPs. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I definitely appreciate some Pink Floyd and Elvis from time to time, but I want to add some of my classics too.
 
Buying records is stupid expensive, and I need to prioritize. Thought it might be fun to crowdsource a list.

To direct the discussion, I tend to favor classic punk, early post-punk, and early hardcore. The first two I‚Äôm after are Wire‚Äôs Pink Flag, Minutemen‚Äôs Double Nickels on the Dime, and the Replacement‚Äôs Sorry Ma.

Where would you go from there? What are your must-have‚Äôs? 

Super pumped to hear how ‚Äúnot-punk‚Äù this idea is. Please note that I wanted to DIY a record collection, but I threw my lathe through an Apple storefront window and it broke."

1206,punk,punk,"(I already tried typing this post once before and it failed on me right before I posted it so I'll be a bit blunt here because I'm grieving over the loss of what was a pretty damn good post.) 

Anyways, recently I've been looking into punk ideologies and the subcultures and all that (mainly because I realized that I tend to agree with a lot of the political views and shit), and I stumbled across a subculture about Riot Grrrls.

I kind of freaked out, because it was just about the most *badass* thing I've ever learned of.

I mean, the whole feminist shit and using what you have to go against the norms that the patriarchy has established for you kind of thing? I fucking love that. I adore it.

I've learned that there's so many ways to piss off old, straight sexist men - body modifications, doing crazy shit with your hair, getting tattoos, etc. - but I'd love to focus more on the fashion and makeup aspect of it.

I want to draw on crazy shit on my face and wear cute, kickass clothes that have meaning (like embracing my femininity but on *my* terms) and be loud and unforgiving when someone says some sexist, homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, what have you shit, y'know? I don't want to be passive anymore.

I also love it because I've always had a shitty time embracing my femininity; I thought that to do that I had to be effortlessly pretty and nice and soft and all that shit.

*Hell no!*

As I learned more about feminism, the movement that I used to see before as unnecessary and misogynist and stupid became a movement that I support with my whole heart (literally just a little bit of research made me go ""*holy shit!*"").

I want to do crazy shit. I want to wear bold makeup and some big platform boots and skirts and shirts with messages that *mean* something to me. I want to create art as a form of expressing my rage against this stupid patriarchy and make zines and scream along to the music and shit.

I really want to be a Riot Grrrl (is that the right terminology? Can I refer to myself as a ""Riot Grrrl""?), but I need to know for certain; is this mentality enough to be able to call myself a Riot Grrrl? Is my idea of the subculture correct? I'm new to punk. I've heard about it before, an ex of mine was mildly obsessed with it, but I never though about it for *myself* until recently. I just want to learn as much as I can. Thank you :)"

Yo. How‚Äôs it? ‚úäüèªü§ûüèª

I‚Äôm sitting here stoned off my arse rn and watching SNFU footage all over YouTube. Currently I‚Äôm watching the Montr√©al ‚ÄòChi Cam‚Äô show (fuckin sick btw if you haven‚Äôt seen it).

I can‚Äôt stop crying straight up. I‚Äôm so wrecked about Chi‚Äôs passing still, jesus fuck. I‚Äôve never in my life felt true grief over a fallen hero. (That I personally didn‚Äôt know.)

I‚Äôm a lifelong fan since the 80‚Äôs and I‚Äôve seen them at least 7 times over the years and honestly I‚Äôve never seen a mediocre or shitty SNFU show. Like never. They were always over the top high energy and just ridiculously crazy and fuckin TIGHT. They had the consistency of McDonalds restaurants always, even despite a ever revolving member door because those members knew they could never fuck up. Amazing when ya think about it.

I grew up with SNFU as my life soundtrack even in years that I barely listened to them. 

I feel fucking blessed to have witnessed a band that shit hot and original. Completely grateful. Yep, grateful. That‚Äôs the word. 

The snowboarding and skateboarding scene in the mid-late ‚Äò90‚Äôs was truly incredible in Vancouver (and probably everywhere actually when you think about it.) and SNFU was so intertwined and part of it. 

Ken ‚ÄòChi Pig‚Äô Chinn is a true enigma and he was a gifted writer and and a true showman if there ever was one. Probably one of the best leads of all time. üêê A major loss for his family and gigantic friend group, music, his city(s), punk music, the world, and Vancouver. 

Did you ever notice that absolutely everyone has a Chi story? üòÇ 

I for one will miss seeing that guy around Gastown. He was part of the woodwork.

Anyway. Sorry for being dramatic.

RIP Chi Pig üê∑

I am actively working in a spotify playlist, trying to find songs to capture that feeling when we first heard our now favourite pop punk song when we were 16. I am continously going through artists, playlists, subreddit etc. to find songs that are stuck in your head when you first hear them and still stuck when you repeat it for the 20th time.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate if you follow the playlist and tell me (honestly) what you think about it. Have any suggestions? I will go through all of them and handpick new entries!

&amp;#x200B;

If you find the playlist above :)"

763,punk,punk,"Hi everyone!

So Let me introduce myself real quickly; I'm a vintage shirt collector with an appreciation of band shirts. I normally can google pretty much everything but this shirt has kept me up for nights...

It is this Ramones shirt:  
\* Front is the ""Eat at chef Wong's"" print that I also found in a 1977 booklet, the japanese marking spell out ramones which I found by googling japanese vinyl.  
\* Back is a piece of the lyrics from Teenage Lobotomy which was released in 1977 on the Rocket to Russia album.

This long sleeve is definitely not from the 70s, or atleast I guess not.  
It's double stitch and the label was cut out (which makes the search difficult!), no inner tags as well.

If anyone has some information, it would help me out!

I got beat up, bullied, and tossed aside in middle school.  I found punk then, but not fully.  I was pissed off and honestly a bit suicidal, but...

Punk music means more to my life then most will ever know, because it taught me how to fight.

Before the gut wrenching anxiety hit, high school did.  I beat the fucking shit out of my middle school bully outside of the PE locker rooms, he squealed while I hit him, one of the more satisfying moments of my childhood.

That fight isn't what I'm talking about, but it seemed like a catalyst.

I got into drugs in high school.  Fuck, I sold them too.  I went overboard one time with Adderall/booze/and an oversized hit from a ""zong"" and hit the floor probably still reeling from opium.

By the time I was 19, I'd been to the ER multiple times thinking I was dying of a heart attack.  Good ole panic attacks.  The good new was I was playing guitar for actually two punk bands.

Punk found me at a place no one should ever be. 

But, it taught me to fight.  It taught me to quit thinking about killing myself.  It taught me to stand up for myself.  It taught me confidence.  It taught me to think for my fucking self.  It taught me that I can rely on good people and that I didn't have to walk alone.  It taught me to be a person that people respect.

In present day, it's taught me to be a Union leader.  And I'll be fucking damned if people don't look at me funny while there's a tie around my neck headed off to work with Reagan Youth blasting inappropriately loudly out my car windows.

About me:

I've been into punk since around 1980, which means I grew up during the cold war, when the threat of nuclear attack was very real. (You know that Discharge band you worship? Those lyrics actually mean something.) Maybe partly because of when I grew up, I began studying things like fallout shelters and nuclear survival when I was in junior high.

I am also someone who can be categorized as a prepper. I'm not as concerned about nuclear war as I once was (I do still think about it), but I do think about, plan, and prepare for other situations. 

Prior to this year, I was already increasing my food storage, off-grid communications, and adding to my supply of batteries, medicines, etc. I was more concerned with an economic collapse and supply-chain failure than anything else at that point.

I first became concerned about the possibility of a serious pandemic in January, when I started seeing the news coming from China, and I adjusted my preps to that specific threat.

Ask a NinJam Moderator on how to set up NinJam and join the fantastic jam we produce.

# How is the Latency Calculated in NINJAM?

Latency is calculated musically in terms of BPI (Beats per Interval) and BPM. Although it is not the perfect solution to jam to a cover with complex chord progression changes or endings, it is the perfect solution for any type of form (ABA), # chord progression, and anything with a static chord progression will be perfect for an amazing jam all around the world and take amazing solos.

Take this video for an example of showing you how to jam online, including how NINJAM works:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ5UQhTRVZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ5UQhTRVZU)

You inspired me to write muisc. The song I Fell in love and wait for it made me realized I didn't need fancy solos to write a emotional song. I can just repeat the same riff and it feel have the same effect. I remember sitting in my room I had opportunities and SGY on repeat. I didn't know how to play the guitar but I picked it up and messed around with the guitar. I just wanted to put my feelings into something. So that's what I did. I'm about to write a song with two of my favorite pop punk singers because of you. Also I got alot of great memories but I already told you a long time ago.


Keep up the good work and thank you. Have a great hoilday or merry Christmas."

Why don't we level the playing field?

Over the years they let it get out of control trusting too many foreign entities to take care of their dirty business. While their people suffer as well. Over population.. Pollution. Mother Nature trying to balance herself out. What are we doing?   Who's punker than who? Antifa isn't punk? Nazis suck? YES they do but most of those people are breed, born, raised and taught their hate and actually Fear the different. Too brainwashed to think for themselves.  By who? The fat cat Klansman too who sit at the table with the people who buy the bricks. 


What we need is to bring back the industry, make our own clothes, and products CUT OUR OWN F@$Kung MEAT!!! Work together to cut what ties we can. Work with country's who want the same. What are you good at? Let's on the job train Them to do it. That would take care of some of the drug addicts and homeless  who couldn't find jobs so they let themselves go into the rabbit hole .

So, I'm asking for a little help. Now, I promise this is NOT a shameless plug, or trying to dupe people in to listen to it. I honestly want to know your opinion if something like this could even be called ""pop punk"". I'm very out of the game when it comes to genres these days, and how much these genres have shifted over the years. I click on link on this page and these ""pop punk"" bands sound very technical and not stripped-down at all, which makes me worry what I'm doing can not be categorized as such. Thus, just asking for your opinion. Not about the song itself, or whether not it's good or bad. But just if this can even be called ""pop punk"", and if you have a better idea of what I should be calling this. I do appreciate it. And thank you!

Punk was founded on individualism and mistrust of authority (this includes right anarchism as well). Now it seems to have been bastardized by auth/lib-left rhetoric.

As a lib-right punk, this makes me feel excluded, we're punks in thought and attitude, and yet we still get scrutiny from our own.

I have a shitty old clipper that I can mow the sides with, but my hawk is over 6 inches now, and none of the gel I have will work on it.  Falls over no matter what I do.

When I was a kid I used egg whites before going to shows, but them fuckers are expensive and sometimes hard to find.  And I like breakfast burritos too much.  SO what's a thing I can find at a CVS or something that I can use to get my hawk back up where it belongs?

Dr. Ruth‚Äôs Pop-Up Guide to Good Sex
If you hated them then, are you gonna be pissed today.
Celebrate 30 years with 12 songs in 15 minutes, split in half. Like a 7‚Äù.
Avid Intent the greatest punk band ever from Cliff, NM with hundreds of tapes sold and almost a dozen fans, and dozens more offended, and angry, perhaps even still pissed off, who gives a rat‚Äôs ass? Anyway, go to http://jackspasm.com to download today.  
Digitally remastered hastily in the last half hour, to bring out the clarity of a 30 year old Radio Shack brand cassette tape it deserves. You will hear warble and noises that will feel like a generation ago when it is no big deal to listen to tapes. It will speed up, it will slow down, sound levels will change with no warning, sound will be louder in the left, then the right, guitar will be out of tune and out of time, and Jack gets the words wrong sometimes.
The release of Dr. Ruth‚Äôs Guide to Good Sex is free now, and will continue to be free. If you download you can send via email anywhere, even your recycling bin.

Moving in trance watch the soldiers dance
Bloodstains on their feet scared of everyone you meet

      I‚Äôve had this conversation with multiple people &amp; it‚Äôs awesome to hear everyone‚Äôs opinion on who are the kings of pop punk. I‚Äôll always defend NFG till the end &amp; they aren‚Äôt even my favorite band. 

     I could talk about all the records they dropped &amp; how influential they were but I won‚Äôt go into that. Imo, they define pop punk. 21 years since there first album dropped &amp; they still haven‚Äôt changed from there roots. They never sold out for main stream attraction, just kept on releasing records. That is what I think is so special about them &amp; is something I can‚Äôt say about any other band. They kept on releasing the music that they wanted too &amp; did not care what the critics had to to say. When they first came out, they received major criticism with Jordan‚Äôs high pitched vocals &amp; that also didn‚Äôt stop them. That is the definition of being punk, sticking to who you are no matter what anyone else thinks. 

By no means do I think they created the genre but they are they perfect definition of a pop punk band. &amp; to anyone who thinks they can‚Äôt do hardcore, give Dig My Own Grave a listen"

If you grew up around me, hes probably a known name, but if not, the man really was incredible. He'd drive all over the area to document shows, from now infamous gigs by many of the founders of Gilman pop punk (Green Day, Operation Ivy, Sweet Baby, Mr T Experience, etc etc) to random house shows of just a few dozen people.

If you've not seen Turn It Around, it's a wonderful documentary largely constructed from his photographs.

And even if you know none of the above, everyone has seen him at least once - he's the photographer reaching an arm up on the Dookie album cover."

566,punk,punk,"Please share your first concert. 

I said ‚Äúreal‚Äù concert in the title because I grew up with my pops playing in local bands and had been to more of their shows than I can count. 

My first ever real concert I was 15 and the lineup was Fenix TX, Bad Religion, and Blink 182 at the George amphitheater in Washington state. That show changed my fucking life. I had been playing drums for a few years and had just started playing guitar, and watching those guys fucking rock out was incredible. Being an aspiring drummer/guitarist, I was amazed when they announced that Travis Barker wouldn‚Äôt be playing that night (apparently he broke his wrist or something punching some dude who was talking shit about his girlfriend, I don‚Äôt remember the details), and that the guitarist from Fenix TX would be filling in for him. And that mother fucker killed it. Being 15 and just getting into music, I was a huge fan of Blink, had been listening to Fenix TX, and had heard a handful of Bad Religion songs. After that show all I wanted to do was play music. And that‚Äôs all I did for many years after. Anyway, I‚Äôm just rambling now. My point is that show changed my fucking life. 

I have never been on this sub and just read that apparently there‚Äôs some bullshit rule about not posting things about Blink 182 or Bad Religion on any day other than Thursdays. Well I give a big punk fuck you and your rules. Delete this post if you really wanna police this shit that hard."

""Be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do
I am he and she is she but you're the only you
No one else has got your eyes, can see the things you see
It's up to you to change your life and my life's up to me
The problems that you suffer from are problems that you make
The shit we have to climb through is the shit we choose to take
If you don't like the life you live, change it now it's yours
Nothing has effects if you don't recognise the cause
If the programme's not the one you want, get up, turn off the set
It's only you that can decide what life you're gonna get
If you don't like religion you can be the antichrist
If your tired of politics you can be an anarchist
But no one ever changed the church by pulling down a steeple
And you'll never change the system by bombing number ten
Systems just aren't made of bricks they're mostly made of people
You may send them into hiding, but they'll be back again
If you don't like the rules they make, refuse to play their game
If you don't want to be a number, don't give them your name
If you don't want to be caught out, refuse to hear their question
Silence is a virtue, use it for your own protection
They'll try to make you play their game, refuse to show your face
If you don't want to be beaten down, refuse to join their race
Be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do
I am he and she is she but you're they only you."""

821,punk,punk,"As a POC is been pretty annoying to see white punks post pics of themselves or their friends from the protests on this sub.

Punk is political, no doubt. But this isnt a general news sub, nor is it an organizing sub. So to me it feels like posting these pics is nothing but a receipt of perceived allyship. 

Theyre concert tshirts, ticket stubs, proof you were there.

Its awesome to know that people of all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds are going to the protests. Solidarity is essential.

But can you, just for once, just be proud that you were there? Know that you did what was right for the sake of doing whats right? Do you really need to cheapen it by posting in a music sub saying, ""Look at me! I was in the streets!""

By all means, please, keep going, keep protesting, keep fighting. 

But also think about *why* you feel the need to share that here. What does your post focus on: oppression &amp; violence that POC face everyday, or yourself? Whats being centered in your post?"

Thats punk we dont give a fuck unless we want to. We aren't bigots(search it up if you dont know what it means),close minded or hypocrites(well that depends i guess). Well to each their own.

2149,poppunkers,poppunkers,I told this guy I've been talking to that there is definitely a pop punk song out there about how your soul mate is probably in another state and I need to find one. HELLLPPP!
620,poppunkers,punk," The song starts off slow with no lyrics and prominent bass line, but towards the end one repeated lyric I remember is ..""now we gotta make a lot of money"". Song is sung in a distinct British accent and more talking rather than singing. I've heard it a few times on Sirius XM The Loft.  Kind of similar to the Buzzcocks or Ian Dury and the Blockheads, but it's not and it's stuck in my head!"

202,punk,punk,"I've seen a lot of them pop up in the comments section lately. They bitch about how punk is too leftist now and right wing ideology are more anti government. To me this is stupidest thing i have ever heard, if you look at any neo nazi group they are always right leaning, same with the kkkk. I feel like these are the same guys who were die hard social d and rancid fans. who never embraced the counter culture politics of punk and instead wanted to look and feel ""badass"" just like their idol lars fredrickson . If you look at all the roots of real punk(not fat records version), You will notice front runner bands such as Conflict, Crass, Dead Kennedy's, etc.. were all extremely left leaning. What do we do to rid the scene of these boomers trying to redefine what punk has always  been about?"

992,punk,punk,"Hi guys, I‚Äôve loved punk for many years now, and I don‚Äôt know if it counts as a punk track exactly, but my favorite punk track is the song Asylum by Crass. I‚Äôve never heard any other punk tracks like it, but I would love to learn of some. 

What I‚Äôm looking for are basically tracks which are:

1. spoken word
2. Deeply Political
3. Extremely incendiary rhetoric
4. Anti religious
5. Lots of good vocabulary, verging on pretentiousness with many obscure words and phrases

Any suggestions would be deeply appreciated. I‚Äôm hoping to feel the same way I did when I first heard that track... it gave me chills in how perfectly and poetically it criticized the religion I grew up up, the thing which has harmed me more than anything else on this earth ever has. I think that song really empowered me to stand up for myself in ways that I‚Äôd never found the strength to do before.

The only tracks which have ever given me a similar feeling are all black metal tracks, Blood In The River by Zeal and Ardor comes to mind, but I‚Äôm hoping to find more tracks like this in the vein of punk."

Also their instagram only follows the other four members, but as far as I know, that was always the case. I know that Jake toured with Mat during his solo runs last year too. 

Just wondering if there‚Äôs any truth to him not being part of the band anymore? I got a chance to talk to him for a few minutes before one of Mat‚Äôs shows last year and he was a super cool dude"
2066,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I'm a big fan of third wave emo pop punk like MCR, Taking Back Sunday, and Fall Out Boy. I'm discovering some newer bands like Knuckle Puck, Real Friends, State Champs, and The Wonder Years(my favorite 2010s band) but they all kind of have the same homogeneous guitar tone and it gets a bit boring to me."
2693,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Seriously, I fuckin love this dude. He and my 5yo son met at one of his solo shows last year, and then again a couple months later at a TGUK show where he chatted with him and gave him a poster. Needless to say my son loves him and gets fucking jazzed over his music. James even printed a series of shirts in kid sizes after I asked him around Christmas time.

So a couple weeks ago, Reggie posted about doing personalized shows on his Insta. So he‚Äôs gonna do a special birthday show for my son with a puppet and whatnot and asked me to find out his 3 favorite Reggie songs.

Dude has a fan for life."

Wasteland by Michael Hawkins is a fiction title that collects stories of young punks growing up in a desolate beach town. Full of cynicism and rich story telling, Michael loosely threads these stories together through the theme of general hopelessness.

Anxiety Report by Shane Spiker is a nonfiction title in the same vain as some Henry Rollins work. This covers a year in the life of a traveling behavior analyst and some of the unique experiences that may be associated with other helping professions.

I know Dave Trenga (aus-rotten, BEL) was having some serious health issues a few years back which involved surgery... but I haven‚Äôt seen a single thing about him since.

452,punk,punk,"I dont need you guys to define what punk is or isn't for me anymore. You even have trouble defining what punk is yourselves, calling everyone poseurs rather than just admitting you're confused. I know I'm punk, and that's all the proof I need. 

This sub has started a trend of mocking conservative punks and I dont appreciate it, nor will I stay to see it.

659,punk,punk,"Aight, so in the past few days I've been looking at punk vests for some inspiration. In these hours of scrolling I 1) Have gotten Carpal Tunnel, and 2) Have noticed an odd trend. A lot of the streetpunk/crust vests have a patch of a local police department([Here's an example](https://66.media.tumblr.com/13074848385a8515ab1bdda3914808ae/tumblr_mo5olrMfgr1rvaxrho1_1280.jpg)). Obviously this is probably both an ironic thing(possibly even a show of bravado like ""Yeah I beat the shit out of a cop and ripped this off his uniform""), as well as a way of communicating where you're from. Is this the case or am I looking at vests made by bootlicking scum?"

Oh and Mr. P is a school teacher where he had to sign a morality clause, so he wears masks to hide his identity and keep his punk band identity a secret.

Each episode a super fan and a hater passionately debate the merits of an artist. Previous episodes discussed [Slayer](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-1-is-fn-slayer-a-fn-fraud/id1494257711?i=1000461975042)**,** [Phish](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-2-phish-the-epic-debate/id1494257711?i=1000466254375)**,** [Morissey](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-3-morrissey-beleaguered-poet-or-pompous-whiner/id1494257711?i=1000470327176)**,** [Rush](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-4-rush-pretentious-precisionists-or-progressive/id1494257711?i=1000474018744), and the [Insane Clown Posse](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-5-insane-clown-posse-masked-buffoons-or-misunderstood/id1494257711?i=1000478640252)**.**

The guests who appear on the podcast are the most extreme fanatics to be found. This includes fans like,[ **Mike Meyer**](https://clrvynt.com/slayer-michael-meyer/), who famously carved ""SLAYER"" into his arms and then lit them on fire. Episode Two‚Äôs Super Fan was **Brian Bavosa**, who has seen Phish perform live over 454 times! The Morrissey episode featured,[ **Jose Maldonado**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwn7Ova2tCk), (AKA, ‚ÄúThe Mexican Morrissey,‚Äù) who hosts a weekly Smiths/Morrissey radio show, has been the singer of Smiths &amp; Morrissey tribute band since 92, and has seen Morrissey perform over 100 times.¬†

The ""Haters"" on this podcast hold similar notoriety and musical pedigree such as Episode One‚Äôs Slayer-Hater **Bram Teitelman,** who is a Napalm Records employee and the co-founder of [www.MetalInsider.net](http://www.metalinsider.net/). Episode Two‚Äôs Phish-Hater and consummate contrarian, **Tim Harrington,** is the singer of the seminal indie rock band, **Les Savy Fav**. Episode Three‚Äôs Morrissey-Hater was **Andrew Novick**, who‚Äôs 1980‚Äôs brat-punk band, **Warlock Pinchers,** penned the brutish and comedic song, ‚ÄúMorrissey Rides A Cockhorse.‚Äù¬† The Rush Hater on Episode Four was Professor **Brian Cogan, Ph.D** who is author of several books on pop culture including, **The Encyclopedia of Punk.** Lastly, arguing against ICP was [**Derrick Braxton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Drop_Braxton)**,** a Grammy winning Hip-Hop engineer and producer who has worked with the likes of Jay-Z and Pharrell Williams.

1871,punk,punk,"My dad gets me a jacket with the intent of letting me put patches on it(which I appreciate). But he has severe narcissistic personality disorder and wants to buy me certain patches of bands that he likes and not the bands I like. And the punk store near me sell their patches for 10 bucks each and I know how to make my own (for free) and he's not letting me do it. Now I am extremely appreciative for the jacket. I am. But him making it something of his and his little art project is absolute Bullshit. I just wanna do my own art. So does anyone suggest any super easy way of making patches so I could stitch em on real fast without him knowing? Just to get at him. He's honestly very angering and an intolerable person to be around even for his wife. (My mom) and there is a real reason I hold so much hate for him. He likes to control everyone and hit women and children. I need fucking help. My mom's plan is to run away but we ain't got money yet. And he takes it all if she does. He broke my mom's fucking back (trying to take her phone) and he's a closeted racist. Now there's one thing I will never let him do and that's taking my freedom of expression, I dress up really gay (not meant to be offensive but I actually dress in a homo way) to get back at him because he doesn't like it. It's just saying fuck you to him in a way he can't stop. He's an absolute pervert. I just wanna fucking get back at him so hard. What do I do about both my issues?"

You'd think after years of being an artist I would have realized that acrylic is a good medium to make patches out of sooner since I could never get it out of my clothes once it dried. Anyway, what's ur favorite way to make patches or some of ur favorite patches u made?

Samhain has a pretty special place in my heart but they didn't put out much stuff and Danzig doesn't check every box for me (mostly because it's not as punky as Samhain). I mean, Samhain is pretty much a combination of HxCx/Punk Rock, Goth Rock and that sweet, sweet B class horror cheesiness, not speaking of that aggressiveness. No other Deathrock or Horror Punk record could scratch that itch for me. Do you guys have more stuff like that?"

FAQ

""What is Punk?""

 It's a music genre, culture, and fashion, if you wanna know more you can check out [the Punk page on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock), or books like Under the Big Black Sun by John Doe and Tom DeSavia, and Please Kill Me by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain, or documentaries like The Decline of Western Civilization, Clockwork Orange County, Another State of Mind, or any of the other hundreds of pages, books, and movies dedicated to Punk and it's history.

""I'm new to Punk what should I listen to first""

 There is so much fantastic Punk music, but I am going to give some Punk albums that I believe to be quintessential and should be required listening. (This is just my opinion obviously there are hundreds of amazing Punk albums but I definitely think this is a great jumping off point)

Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables - Dead Kennedys

The Ramones - The Ramones

Damaged - Black Flag

Damned Damned Damned - The Damned

Los Angeles - X

London Calling - The Clash

Bad Brains - Bad Brains

""What is Lace code? Is Lace Code still followed?"" 

 Lace code is mostly dead, certain people still follow it and it is stronger in some places than others. Lace code is telegraphing your beliefs, actions or group with the color of your laces. It only applies to ladder lacing on black combat boots. It is also primarily used by Skinheads but is also used by Punks.

Black laces = Neutral/No meaning

White laces = Racist/Nazi/White Power

Red = Nazi or in certain places RedSkin/RASH (Red and Anarchist Skinheads)

Yellow = SHARP (Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice)/Anti-racist

Personally I wear Pink laces, and that just means I like the color Pink

""What do you think of G.G. Allin?""

He was a rapist stop talking about him

""Where do I get Punk clothing?""

There are plenty of online stores you can get Punk stuff from, but the best Punk gear is always DIY, you feel more confident in it because you made it yourself and it creates more fun and interesting conversations when you are out and about or at a show (eventually). So try thrifting and creating your own stuff, go to r/BattleJackets for more help on that. It's also important to support bands, especially now, so hit up your local bands for merch or the online stores of some of those bigger bands you wanna rep. 

""Gatekeeping isn't Punk""

We know thanks."
2085,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I live in NYC. And with everything going on now it doesn‚Äôt seem feasible to get together with people and work on songs. I was hoping to find like minded people who want to have fun and share ideas. I play guitar, and I figure most people do, but I have access to GarageBand and can share tracks with others. Not to create something serious more to just write as a hobby and become better through feedback and playing with others. Any info would be a great help. Thank you all in advance."
2322,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Modern pop punk has obviously evolved but I'm wondering if there are any bands who sound like they're from the early 2000s. I'm thinking Sum 41's All Killer No Filler / New Found Glory's Catalyst / Mest's Destination Unknown. I want to listen to something that reminds me of skateparks, baggy Dickies shorts and tube socks."

[How the mighty have fallen.](https://preview.redd.it/xzbvo0aastb51.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0397035d05c299289d433924652d0e1c669c7fd0)

Maximum Rocknroll was on the forefront of punk in the -80s and -90s. But MRR has fallen low from the days when Tim Yohannan ran it as a personal obsession.

MRR went from Tim‚Äôs driving passion to a California C Corporation run by an anonymous Board of Directors after Tim died. MRR has always pretensions for the punk scene‚Äôs PC police but they have been skirting the law in reality always also. The MRR corporation operates by exploiting the all-volunteer labor of punk rockers who are coordinators, shitworkers and contributors for the magazine. In California it‚Äôs illegal for corporations to use volunteer labor to run their business without paying people for their work. The MRR print magazine ended in May 2019 and MRR is now completely online digital only. But they are still a corporation that operates by exploiting volunteer labor instead of paying people their due.

By September 2019 a MRR coordinator sued the corporation for back wages. Her name is Victoria Cassis and she sued MRR through the State of California Labor Commissioner‚Äôs Office. State Case Number WC-CM-714115CW. MRR hired a Berkeley law firm but they realized soon they couldn‚Äôt win the case because what MRR did and is still doing is illegal. So MRR settled with Vicky Cassis out of court for $11,000 in back wages. The reason no one hears about this is because MRR made Vicky sign a non-disclosure agreement to exchange for the settlement and all public records are sealed. But that didn‚Äôt stop MRR from harassing Vicky Cassis even after they paid her back wages. Vicky‚Äôs band Coherence went on tour in the Pacific Northwest and MRR goons called all the venues and forced the band to cancel the tour. MRR has plenty of other dark secrets.

If you ever volunteered for MRR you were illegally exploited. You are being illegally exploited now if you volunteer for MRR. You are rightfully owed payment for your work. Stop being exploited! Demand the money MRR owes you!"

1417,punk,punk,"[My pictures from that day.](https://imgur.com/gallery/2CcmKac)

A little over a year ago I was invited backstage to meet one of my favorite bands The Descendents at SABROSO 2019 in Dana Point, CA. 
I was invited on short notice just a week before show. I was granted an all access backstage pass. I remember arriving a little late to the show but still grabbed a beer and headed backstage just as Face to Face was on and I got to see the remainder of their set from the stage, after their set I got a picture with Dennis from Face to Face - had a quick chat, cool dude.

I was watching Black Flag set up next and while that was happening I see Mike Vallely next to me - I got a quick chat &amp; handshake with him. Unfortunately, but for good reasons I didn‚Äôt get to see any of Black Flags set as I got called offstage to meet none other than The Descendents! The whole band sat down with me &amp; we talked for about 10-15 min, got a photo op with the band &amp; signed setlist.

After the interaction with the Descendents I got a photo op with The Offspring, that was cool too. Also while backstage I see one of the wrestlers in a gold mask who just happens to be none other than Ramses from Nacho Libre. Unfortunately a few months later he passed away, RIP Ramses.

After the photo op with the Offspring and the interaction with Ramses I hurry back on stage as the Descendents are setting up to play next. All I can say is that it was a fucking amazing and an unforgettable experience to watch one of my favorite bands literally right from the stage. The view was amazing, got a guitar pick from Stephen Egerton, another cool souvenir. 

After the Descendents there was a taco eating contest that probably took about 20 min just to set up. While that was happening I see Wee-Man from the corner of my eye walking on stage and without hesitation comes over to me and gives me a fist bump. That was really awesome since I grew up watching Jackass when it originally aired back on MTV. 
Once the taco eating contest started it was intriguing to watch all the contestants stuff tacos in their face. I believe the winner ate about 150 tacos give or take. There was a scary moment when one of the contestants started choking and was given the Heimlich maneuver but was okay. After they were done I got a picture with one of the contestants who also happens to be a Guinness world record holder Takeru Kobayashi. After the taco eating contest was over I also got to watch the Offspring close out the show from the stage. While they played I happen to see singer Deryck Whibley of SUM41 standing next to me, although not a fan it was still cool.

It was an unforgettable experience and I‚Äôm thankful for the whole band who took time out of their schedule to sit and talk with me. Also a few weeks later I made it into the recap video of the festival on the Instagram page."

Dave Swanson targets YOUNG GIRLS of color to manipulate and abuse   
I want to talk about my story because apparently it's okay to take advantage of young girls, lie about drug use, lie about STDs, and deny all forms of cheating and abuse!  

Dave and I saw eachother when I was into the scene in chicago and he told me he was in a band which I don't remember but it was a number (Fact check i dont fucking remember) and a band with his ex girlfriend who I have  never met.

Dave is really sweet at first and is like your best friend right off the bat, he makes you feel comfortable, he tells you his stories, tells you how much he cares about you and introduces you to all his friends. Now that I remember everything CLEARLY i can't believe this guy has friends from all the lying and manipulative things he did.

Dave was talking to another person right before I stopped hearing from him and, he did it to the next girl (who contacted me somehow) and Im sure hes done it again and again. He is abusive as hell, as soon as I got to know him being around him was like being around a bomb. AND NOTHING IS HIS FAULT, every time he explodes at you its because ""hes loud or had a bad day or he is having panic attack"" He makes you believe he is an accepting guy but is secretly judging you and everyone he knows he talks shit about. I thought he was just kidding but he even talks shit about these two girls that he calls them best friends. He was open about him being addicted to heroin but because I was young and dumb, we didnt use condoms and I got an STD. Later on I told my now boyfriend he started asking me questions about him. Then my bfs friends and my friends started asking me questions about him. I was confused because I was over him but apparently being with him made me weirder.

Guess what I went to therapy and realized: Dave Swason is a manipulator, he gets you to spend money on him, he uses his trauma to get exactly what he wants, he cries to gaslight you, he steals from you (over $100 worth of thstuff), he lies to you about body safety (he gave me STD AND didnt tell me he was doing sex for money WHILE WE WERE DATING), he lies to his friends in front of your face and then tells you why later, he uses people for their house, for their drugs, for their attention.  He tells you he is not racist, homophobic, or sexist but he makes ALL THOSE JOKES and says someone else said them, he talks LIKE A PIG about womens bodies, he is not a safe person. He has never been a safe person. TELL YOUNG GIRLS AND ALL GIRLS THAT DAVE SWANSON IS AN ABUSER. It would not surprise me if I was not the only one and It would not surprise me to learn that he has did rapey acts before. 

I dont want to get too explicit to preserve mine and my boyfriends privacy but Dave manipulates people into sex and lies to you about his clean status. I have been recovering from my BRIEF time with him ever since because it was sooooo hiddenly traumatizing. I am speaking out because I now have the words to talk about the abuse that went on. A girlfriend should NOT have to talk to down from hurting yourself because I said something that made you feel bad, a girlfriend should NOT have to find out you are doing drugs behind her back and not caring for safety (uses needles), a girlfriend should not have to find out that you were sleeping around doing sex for money, a girlfriend should not have to feel scared everytime you are mad, a girlfriend should not have to PAY for everything even though you said you had a job, a girlfriend should not have to get STDs as a surprise from you, a girlfriend should not have to see you treat everyone like shit, a girlfriend should not have to feel so manipulated that you don't know which way is up.

When I met dave he told me that people didn't like him, that he learned from his past, and that I can trust him. WRONG. I will say he is an abuser, liar, and puts people at risk for STDS. My friend and BF are saying that he is a sexual assaulter because of the stories i told them around sex (he would convince me to do things i didnt want to) and because he didnt use condoms when i would ask, AND because he was doing sex for money without telling me. I know he seems like he has changed but he hasnt until he starts ADMITTING how much of a slimeball he is. 

The reason im posting this is for 3 reasons:  1) Dave gave me an STD and because I didnt know what was wrong with me so long it got worse if he told me he was cheating or doing sex for money i could have gotten help sooner

2) because I know how people around him don't think hes capable of this, IM TELLING YOU HE IS, HE HAS PROBABLY LIED AND STOLEN FROM YOU TOO

3) because my friend ran into someone during covid that used to be friends with his ex girlfriend and told me HOW HE ABUSED HER PHYSICALLY TURNED HER ONTO DRUGS AND WAS SO SO SO MANIPULATIVE

This is a grown man not a child, he can answer what he did, and BECAUSE i know he won\\t I want everyone to know so atleast girls stay safe. Thank you.

2466,poppunkers,poppunkers,I was listening to [a discussion](https://www.reminiscentpodcast.com/blog/new-found-glory-all-downhill-video-winners-and-losers) about it being a work of art as compared to the Sum 41 *action figure video* and was curious if you all had any under-the-radar favorites.
2037,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I know it wasn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs favorite, but the production/arrangement on Trophy Eye‚Äôs the American Dream was very well done. In your opinion, who currently is writing the best songs in the Pop Punk scene right now?"

1144,poppunkers,punk,"I try using programs like Spotalike to try to get similar sounding tracks, but every time I use it I end up getting other tracks by the band or sister bands, when in reality I'm looking for tracks that sound similar sonically and structurally, not just tracks of the same genre or artist. Anyone got any tracks that SOUND like Hybrid Moments?"
728,punk,punk,"Punk is pure positivity. It's about exposing and fighting injustice and hate, doing the best you can to make the world a better place. Having an open mind and resisting power. It's about living life the way you want to. It's about fighting for peace and equality for all living beings. What does punk mean to you?"
2295,poppunkers,poppunkers,"So, which pop punk songs do you like most, covered by other pop punk bands?

One of my favs is [Stand Atlantic - Your Graduation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYAjot43CGE), I like it even more than the Modern Baseball original version. Her voice is really ideal for that song."

Personally I feel that it makes it sound like some cheesy 80‚Äôs pop song and I just not here for it. For example. Neck Deep - In Bloom. It just sounds cheesy af and sounds soooo out of place.

What are your thoughts?"

 It‚Äôs official: My Chemical Romance is back, and they‚Äôre heading out on their first tour across North America in nine years.

The emo-rock group, which split in 2013, announced that they would reunite this past fall. They returned to the stage for a sold-out show at the Shrine Expo in Los Angeles, followed by previously-announced gigs in the UK. Now, they‚Äôre slated to return to the states with a tour kicking-off on September 9 in Detroit, Michigan. From there, they‚Äôll visit Toronto, Atlanta, Houston, and Denver, making appearances along the way at arenas like Brooklyn‚Äôs Barclays Center, TD Garden in Boston, the Tacoma Dome in Washington, and The Forum in Los Angeles. Las Vegas will round-out the trek on October 11 at the T-Mobile Arena.

My Chemical Romance announced the tour with a short film dubbed ‚ÄúA summoning‚Ä¶‚Äù The video features music from band members Ray Toro and James Muhoberac while a young boy tries to outrun three masked figures.

(I am not english native so it is why I am not 100% sure of the lyrics)

Some years ago I was listening a punk song but I lost the name of it and I wasn't able to recover it. It would be amazing if someone here know it! I searched for it on song search by lyrics tools, on google, on youtube trying to browse suggestions etc... And I found nothing. I think I intially found it by Youtube suggestions listening to The Vibrators / The Only Ones.   
Normal: almost sure of the lyrics   
\[...\]: don't remember or can't understand/put it into lyrics  
{} not sure of the lyrics  
The song is joyfull and motivating, it starts with 3/4 taps on the drums and then ""In the morning when I wake up, I\[...\] {to take up}. \[...\]{staring trough my window}\[...\] a girl I used to knooooooooowwww} \[...\] {make it\[...\] take it}

He's got 40k followers on instagram but all his most obvious racist, homophobic shit got deleted before the Bombs toured again and now he just posts stupid conservative bullshit every so often.

1424,punk,punk,"Hello all! It's been 9 months since I started doing art and illustration full-time and during this time, I've had the pleasure of working with some fantastic bands from around the world. While it hasn't changed much, the COVID19 outbreak has had some effect on my work. It isn't bad, it's definitely nowhere close to what most full-time musicians, small-business owners or people in the service industry are going through, but I have lost a few jobs. Hence, I wanted to make this post to **invite fresh commissions**.

I'm a pen and ink illustrator from Bangalore (India) and I mostly draw poster art, album covers and such for bands from around the world. I have, in the past, drawn for bands like **Opeth, Anathema, Envy, Mono, A Place To Bury Strangers, Conan, Nadja, Crowhurst, Wang Wen (ÊÉòÈóª), Death By Fungi, Jugaa and so on.** While most of my work revolves around art and illustration, I also take up graphic design work - CD/vinyl/tape layouts, merch mock-ups, press kits, social media adapts and such.

So yeah, if you're someone who could use my art or graphic design skills in any capacity, write to me at **studio@anoopkbhat.in** or just drop me a message here on Reddit. Serious inquiries only, my fees are pretty reasonable. Here's an [Imgur photo album](https://imgur.com/gallery/64NZ0gb) with some of my recent work. For my complete portfolio, you'll have to visit my [website](https://anoopkbhat.in/) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/anoopkbhat). Thank you so much for reading and have a nice day! Stay indoors, stay safe.

But I feel that the title track of this album would have been a better choice. It still has the ATL sound/energy from the previous album while also including the synthy New Wave aesthetic of the whole album. This would have helped ease the fans into the era instead of doing it in such a sudden fashion. ""Dirty Laundry"" was a full blown Synthpop song that was an out-of-left field move on the band's behalf. No disrespect to the band, but this was a bad choice of a lead single in my opinion."

172,punk,punk,"4am Political Rant.  How is Trump's clown car of criminals any different from Bush V Gore 2004 or The DNC screwing over Sanders.  American Patriotism is synonymous with not seeing the storm in the sky and wondering why there is Thunder and Lightning.  Some people got woke in 2019.  I got woke in 1987.  Poor and living on MLK Blvd in Long Beach.  Watts riots, then oh no we got distracted by the next bullshit news article or celebrity death or shiny opject.bject

We need to try to defeat Trump in the polls.  That will probably not work. Then we take action, By Any Means necessary.  Fix america: 1) Invert military spending and education spending.  Hate and crime is fueled by ignorance and no choices.  2) Healthcare for ALL.  3) Adequately tax large corporations and the wealthy.  If they are going to buy the American dream atleast lets get tax dollars for it.

When I hear ""All Lives Matter"" I realized that racism and bigotry has gotten SO PERFECTED it applies to ALL the disenfranchised unfortunately the difference ladies and gentlemen is....  The POINT IS THAT BLACK AND MEXICAN AND MUSLIM brothers ARE DYING because of it.  Dying in cages, dying by those who swore to protect and serve AND in the poverty draft.  They might tout patriotism but you are not part of their America.

Be part of OUR AMERICA!!! BLACK AND TRANS, GAY AND WHITE, MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN(not just those combinations).  ACCEPTING SUPPORTING AND DYING for EVERYONE'S RIGHTS.  NOT JUST WHITE WIG WEARING MOTHERFUCKERS LAND OWNERS ON PIECES OF PAPER or Jeff Bezos's next billion or Hollywoods next white washed reboot.

You want change DO IT.  I mentor kids with drug/alcohol problems in PSYCH WARDS.  Talk about the forgotten ones.    Spend money on THEM not on Louisville Metro Police's next purchase of military grade hardware.

My RAGE knows no bounds but neither does my love.  Im a citizen OF EARTH.  Patriotism is selective priority.  The principles are the same.  Keep doing what you are doing, or not doing (VOTING) and you keep getting thus near DYSTOPIA.

I'm done, down vote me I don't care, MIC DROP"

Someone said it was just autotune put to use. If you have software that can separate vocals from a song, you'll be able to hear his voice more clearly and probably hear how much was actually used.

1505,punk,punk," Hello, The song i'm trying to find is a punchy punk track, probably by a German (berlin if i m right)solo(?) artist who wears white face paint, and a big black dot around one of his eyes. I guess it's from the 00's. The lyrics  are in English and go a little like this ""i like"" ""something"" you like ""something"". The whole is basically a list of the opposite things the singer likes and what the person he is addressing likes. It s pretty much an attack on the bourgeoisie if I remember correctly. I discovered the artist while watching tracks on Arte. The video of the song should have him going wild on the streets of Berlin with a cast costumed freaks. The song is short, very simple in structure, very energetic, great for a party. Thank you in advance"

I recently formed a new band Pinata_Partay and am having trouble really gaining traction. We have done a few originals and are currently working on finding musicians and writing more music. Our YouTube is pretty barebones though our Instagram @pinata_partay has most of our info. Anyway, I just wanted some thoughts on the three originals we have done so far. I am the vocalist for two of them and sax player in the other one. Any thoughts would be appreciated, though I definitely can't pull off the vocals for a full concert without killing my voice and I do love sax and ska so we will likely continue to try to do a mix of styles, especially with our drummer who really likes metalcore.

This tournament will be for the Mark, Tom, &amp; Travis Era.
I've combined listener data across streaming services to come up with the seeding. 
[**Here's the bracket graphic**](https://imgur.com/a/dsH0LOG)

After this tournament I will organize a Pre-Travis Era Tournament, then a Post-Tom Era Tournament to eventually combine into the ultimate Blink 182 Madness Tournament! 

Here are the planned dates for the tournament:

**Round 2** voting will end Wednesday, 4/8/20 (6 PM ET/GMT-4)

**Round 3** voting will end Saturday, 4/11/20 (6 PM ET/GMT-4)

**Round 4** voting will end Tuesday, 4/14/20 (6 PM ET/GMT-4)

**Round 5** voting will end Thursday, 4/16/20 (6 PM ET/GMT-4)

**Round 6** (Final) voting will end Saturday, 4/18/20 (6 PM ET/GMT-4)

Hope everyone enjoys the tournament!"

I love this band, their sound is solid, and they def deserve some exposure. Let's help some brothers out, especially with the current situation.

I really like these bands/albums/songs and recently I've been trying to find other music that's similar; could you maybe help me out? I *think* they're pop punk but I'm not entirely sure; if you know what genre they are then please let me know.

All I know is that it was probably an early 2000s about a guy who loved a girl that was with someone else. Her boyfriend(?) wasn't a great guy or good to her or something like that. I'm not sure. Also there could be a reference to flowers in the song or title? I don't remember the name of the song OR the band it came from üòî. I really want to find the song though, so if it sounds familiar PLEASE let me know! 
I know it's a long shot to ask! Thanks!"
717,punk,punk,"It‚Äôs a trend I have noticed on this sub and in the punk community as a whole. I have very strong personal preferences against both of those ideologies, and feel authoritarianism from either ‚Äúside‚Äù of the political spectrum are both equally as wrong on a fundamental level. Ideas of freedom and telling the people who try to dictate your life to fuck off are what drew me to punk in the first place. Just want to hear some opinions on this and perhaps open a discussion on what I feel is an interesting dichotomy, seeing as both have led to horrible tragedies and loss of life and liberty on a tremendous scale. I understand that the up front anti-semitism, homophobia, racism, etc. of the nazis (especially the modern ones, and I do see this much less in modern communists) draws a divide in people‚Äôs minds, but communism had just as much of those within the governments that functioned on it. I don‚Äôt think either are exactly ‚Äúpunk‚Äù."

It's my life and I'll do what I choose  
It's not your life, you've got nothing to lose

1061,punk,punk,"I just drunk messaged one of my best friends dad saying him and his wife are some of the most  solid people that been in my life.
I was drunk listening to old local bands (suburbs of Chicago) and I realized that our whole scene was heavily supported by this very beautiful couple. 

They owned the house we had shows at.

 They housed a ton of dumb punk kids. Including make rent way to cheap.

They came and supported all the bands even touring. 

They never judged anyone for anything they were doing.

If you asked for help the would pull you up on to your feet.

They are the people I think of when I here ""community builders"". 

What's nuts about it is that they are a traditional Chicago suburbs Christian couple.  
I have seen tons of bands that are still around and even play big venues/fests,  in a basement that should only hold 10 people with like 30 people, because 2 people wanted to see their kids live life well. 
I owe them decades old friends and memories and I could never return the favor. 
So again don't forget the people that support your scene. Let them know that you're appreciative."

2469,poppunkers,poppunkers,Cartel will always be one of the most criminally underrated bands from the early 2000s imo.  Chroma is a top 10 album for me.  They nailed the pop punk formula and seemed to be in the right place at the right time but they never got that last explosion to push them to the top.  I really don't understand it because their content was right up there with Yellowcard and Simple Plan.
3649,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hey guys - Worked on this in spare time over the course of a few years.  Would love feedback on it - positive or negative I‚Äôm open to any critiques. 
A lot of influence drawn from blink-182 , Boxcar Racer , Yellowcard, Gaslight Anthem , Rise Against , New Found Glory, Brand New etc you just may dig it. Spotify also has a B-Sides album from me and an Acoustic album from me if you find you like this album and wanna hear more! :)

651,punk,punk,It came out in 1998 not 1988. Just because the album cover is old timey doesn't make it old. Just because the name is The Shape of Punk to Come doesn't make it a revelation. Hoover and Indian Summer did a lot of their gimmicks before  them and In/Casino/Out came out months before.  Hell even Atari Teenage Riot was doing a lot of their shit years before
571,punk,punk,"last post i described a dislike of pop punk: specifically green day, blink 182 and offspring. was decried as a gatekeeper.

 i like to think of 'punk' as derived from the 70's movement in the UK; anti-social; anti populist; free-thinking; non-conservatist. 

seems that if we listen to studio prescribed / populalist derived music with a certain cadence and some twee anti-establishment lyrics then we're 'punk'?

and before anyone says there are many definitions of punk, fuck you, explain yourself without getting upset. but please explain how your definition of 'punk' relates to the origin, otherwise you're just hijacking a culture in which case you're a cunt."

If I‚Äôm going to be honestly the band I‚Äôm trying to start is essentially counterparts in a major key with clean vocals. Any resources I could use to really get into advanced chord building and scales???"
786,punk,punk,"I started my musical journey loving Adam and the Ants and Shakin Stevens! Early '80s, I probably got my first cassette player in 1980 or so. The first album I ever bought with my own money was Powerage by AC/DC, it's still my favourite album and Sin City is still my favourite song.

In High School I became a metalhead, secretly loved pop and soul, but on the outside I was all about thrash and speed metal. Shock metal like W.A.S.P. and gradually learned to love the crossover between metal and punk. Still, to this day, Suicidal Tendencies are my second favourite band, AC/DC will always hold their crown.

I played Slayer and Death Angel and Kreator and Acid Reign etc. to piss my parents off, to make them listen to me while I defended myself.

When I got to college and was introduced to music like Public Enemy, Dead Kennedys and REM I started realising that the music I wanted my parents to hate had a purpose!

Dead Kennedys especially caught my interest, these were songs I could understand politically, arguments and ideas that resonated with my own developing political ideals. I listened to more punk, but it really didn't do much for me, UK Subs &amp; The Exploited etc sang about lost jobs and Thatcher. She was long gone at that stage. Sex Pistols were catchy but I preferred the Megadeth version.

Got a professional job, got married, had a kid, went into a musical hiatus for many years, loved REM &amp; Crowded House, but reverted to the more alternative chart music.

Then I found Tony Hawk on Playstation! Rise Against, Flogging Molly, all this wonderful music I had missed. Started discovering music again, found NOFX, Pennywise, Less than Jake... Started becoming politically aware again, started thinking again, because of this music.

Fast forward through divorce, financial collapse, several disastrous relationships, coming out as bi, discovering motorbikes and rediscovering guitars...

I am now, at 48, the person I wish I was at 18, not knowledge or experience, just someone who is kind. Punk culture, punk people, punk bands, punk audiences, are kind. I've never felt love like I've felt love at at a punk show, getting a selfie with Jerry Only or just chilling with the crowd before seeing Rise Against. We CARE for each other, we love each other, we look after each other, we make sure that our most vulnerable members are looked after and are kept safe.

We look outward, we see injustice and we stand up and shout and march, we fight the government when it is wrong. We fight for a better world, a just world, a free world, a caring world. For all of us.

We are Punks, we are Love, we care, we look scary but we love kittens and puppies and are anti suffering even if we aren't vegan, if we are vegan we don't preach about it, we only want to scare the unjust authorities and take care of our own.

For a sub culture that look like extras from a Mad Max movie we are the most responsible humans for this planet."

This song has grown with me for the past two years and it‚Äôs one of my favorites by ttsf. Love the meaning behind moving forward from the past and dealing with regrets, grief, and growing up, esp. as an artist. Listen to the sounds of the synth combined with the drums throughout. For me, it helped me overcome feelings of being overwhelmed whenever I listened to it. This was a song I listened to while riding the L in Chicago in my last year at Uni and it made going to classes a lot easier, especially since those classes were with my ex. If you can, try to imagine early sunrise blinding your vision as your riding a train car cramped with a shit ton of people going to a place that brings you joy - but at the same time dread, oh and you‚Äôre feeling exhuasted being a young adult in college.

My interpretation is similar to NotNowII‚Äôs answer in the old post. When things are going not so
smoothly with your significant other, you have to find some positive energy to lift you back up. I think Jake knows he's ultimately in control of his happiness and no matter what happens he can always be grateful that he has himself and this earth. He is embracing himself as he is and giving thanx back to this earth for providing him a life, almost in a rather Pagan manner.  Quotes like ‚Äúcrawl down on my hands and knees in heartbeat, if i had to‚Äù gave me an image of him praising this earth because its ‚Äúthe least‚Äù he could do for it. When I first heard this song I definitely interpreted it as failed relationship, but most emo/pop-punk/watever can be compared to that. Overall Jake knows this relationship with the world is going to be tough...with him not being the only one in the relationship with the world...and know that there is ups and downs just like it would be in relationship with a person. 

Let me know what you think. Thank you!"

Anyways, so often I‚Äôll see a young punk make a ‚Äúfuck Nazis‚Äù post, ‚Äújust got my first mohawk‚Äù post, or something cliche. Instead of supporting young, enthusiastic punks, old punks are shitting all over their spirit with comments like ‚Äúso original‚Äù or ‚Äúhow about you do something original instead of following the corporate controlled image of punk‚Äù.

Yes, punk cliches have become more or less corporate controlled from stores like Hot Topic and Vans, but you‚Äôre not helping. Instead of saying ‚Äúhey, maybe you can go to a food drive or  a local political protest instead of Nazi hunting‚Äù in an attempt to redirect their young spirit, you‚Äôre blatantly putting them down. Instead of helping guide young punks away from corporate influence, you‚Äôre just ridiculing them.

3533,poppunkers,poppunkers,"So as a lot of people here probably as well, I am a 90s kid. I grew up listening to Blink 182 on my way to houseparties on weekends, bingewatching American Pie and dying my hair listening to Offspring while feeling like the biggest punk in the world. While my taste in music eventually matured, and I got into more heavier music, I never really lost my love for powerchords and nanana‚Äòs.   

Sadly tho, Pop Punk changed drastically with the 2010s, and my taste in Pop Punk didn‚Äòt change with it back then. So I stuck with the same old bands except for a couple exceptions (mainly Neck Deep, who I‚Äòd still consider to be quite oldschool tho).   

Anyways, lately I‚Äòve been trying to get into some modern Pop Punk stuff, and to my surprise I actually quite liked a bit of it. I love ROAM, or Grayscales song ‚ÄûYoung‚Äú for example. The problem is that it‚Äòs been 10 years now, and I kinda feel owerwhelmed with all the bands I missed.

Does anyone else have any negative experiences with Jimmy Webb? Almost everyone I know from the NYC punk/rocknroll scene has had similar experiences with him. Preying on young dudes, getting them to come over to his house, getting them black out drunk &amp; giving them drugs (while he stayed sober) and then being molested or raped by him. I also know so many other people who have had experiences of him looking over changing rooms while they're getting changed, jimmy grabbing peoples genitals or even just making gross comments. he was notoriously awful to work for. Theres even a review on the trash facebook from a customer who said that jimmy molested him on his 14th bday in the store. 

Does anyone else have a similar experience? SO MANY people I know who were never affected by him but knew what his did posted on their socials about how sad it was that he died. 

I am tired of serial rapists and pedophiles getting away with hurting people because of their status. 

People need to know he was not a good person. He was evil and ruined peoples lives."

i'm trying to start a band but outside is now closed, plus not a lot of people are into punk in the Caribbean. not much of a scene to jump into, and while i am more than willing to attempt to kickstart a movement, i don't know where to start. everything's expensive, but more, because import taxes.

I've always understood Libertarianism to mean ""Equal rights for everyone. Do what you feel is best for your life as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others."", ""Live and let live."" if you will. So I just want to know when punk became about ""Left vs. Right"". I've always lived with the ""Us vs. Them"" mentality.

The first being [The Mullets](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4976YDNDuiCx1salf8Yb8f?si=14FeQlNpTHS_HrLS4vWxMA) , I find their lyrics to be smart, funny, and very catchy. Their style, at first listen appears to be the overused pop punk sound, being from 1999, but it seems apparent to me it‚Äôs ironic, especially with the lyrics. My favorite album by them, Typical Stereo, is so fun to listen to. Another album, Fork, Knife, Spoon, Shut Up, is hilarious. A big influence on the presentation I give my band. 

Next is [Nice Guys Finish Last](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jdEI7oKs5IXCWRpWZUmJX?si=ii2NK7YDSUKGC78CXabz8w) , they actually share an EP with The Mullets. I love their sound in a completely different way. I‚Äôve always been fond of that DIY garage sound. Certain songs just seem to crumble accidentally and then they all pull together with a heavy hook. Still, with that ironic pop punk sound, they just sound like they‚Äôre having fun. Which makes it fun for me to listen to. 

Lastly for this list is [The Farmers](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3jdpu5cIM48XslN90V3Irp?si=qiVtA_xUSVeCHDTM6Ik5jw) , specifically the album, Flames of Love. (Adding that link actually made me see that they recently came out with an album in 2011 that I haven‚Äôt heard yet, maybe I‚Äôll give it a listen to day). I came to enjoy their sound during my Violent Femmes phase. Folk punk with lightly played distorted guitar. It actually seems like this album does have any bass guitar. Their songs are very simple, with catchy chorus, and Bruce Springsteen-ish, catchy lyrics. They‚Äôre just enjoyable to listen to. 

Tell me your thoughts on these bands if you choose to listen to them, or if you‚Äôve heard of them before and have any information about them! 

What are some bands you‚Äôve come across that hold a place in your heart and fly under the radar? Thanks for reading and I look forward to your responses."
652,punk,punk,I had this sampler cd. I don't remember much about it but I know the first track was called Can Punk Rock Pay The Bills. It was a live recording where they are talking about pirate hats before the song.
2871,punk,poppunkers,"I've been trying to find this for a while and i can't, was wondering if anyone here can help me. I saw a photo of Joel from Being As An Ocean wearing a shirt that was basically the cover of Can't Swim's Death Deserves A Name album. Does anyone know if there's anywhere i can buy the shirt?"
100,punk,punk,"Hello,

This might seem rather dull but have some concerts next year and I don't know how to keep my belongings on me while in the mosh pit. Does anyone know of any good ways to keep my stuff on me? This is one of my first so I am in desperate need of help."
3262,poppunkers,poppunkers,"How many of you shared or saw shared pictures this week? Brilliant marketing, but also screams 'hailcorporate' everytime I see these posts."
996,punk,punk,"Hey reddit punks, we've got a new one out. Head on over to [http://ihatethemoguls.bandcamp.com](http://ihatethemoguls.bandcamp.com) today and enjoy!"
3431,poppunkers,poppunkers,Was curious if anyone had the setlist from this show cause I don't see it on setlist.fm. Taking my sister to the show tonight in Tampa and want to get her as familiarized as possible
3162,punk,poppunkers,"Money is tight so i like to know what i'm going to have to bring ahead of time, lmao"

2521,poppunkers,poppunkers,Hey so I‚Äôve just picked up my cousins old electric guitar. I don‚Äôt really know much about them tbh. I‚Äôve figured out it‚Äôs single cool but that‚Äôs it.

1047,punk,punk,"There‚Äôs tons of styles of punk that never get love on this subreddit and people are too reluctant to accept them. every time I go on here, it‚Äôs a meme/fanart of the same classic 30 punk and 30 hardcore bands. People consistently repost NOFX/Rancid/Descendants adjacent/clones of their music and show much love and appreication for them and never other styles (Noise Punk, No Wave, Beatdown Hardcore, Screamo)
Whenever people post these genres, or anything that‚Äôs subgenre of punk or hardcore, they‚Äôll get a couple of upvotes and like 3-5 comments at best.

Here are genres of punk/hardcore punk that I‚Äôd see never see here and I‚Äôll discuss them

Powerviolence (Spazz, Infest, Gasp, Capitalist Casualties, Charles Bronson, The Endless Blockade, Hellnation)

An absurd hardcore punk subgenre with fastcore/thrashcore roots, taking dissonant and raw elements of the genres, and takes small elements of noise rock. It‚Äôs the most extreme style of pure hardcore punk, not fusing it with metal and it isn‚Äôt a crossover genre. It‚Äôs a noticeable characteristic to have sludge metal moments and revert right back up to intense speed and chaos. It can oftentimes be confused and hard to tell apart with grindcore, a genre I‚Äôll get into later.

There‚Äôs barely any powerviolence posted here. There‚Äôs barely any love or attention for the genre, Not one single essential post about Powerviolence that is posted here that even has over 100 upvotes. I don‚Äôt see why this might not be posted here. Too chaotic? Too weird? A bit more gnarly then the usual Black Flag or Fear for you? I don‚Äôt know. But hey, we can post 90s pop punk/melodic hardcore with raspy singing all the time, because that NEVER gets too much attention, doesn‚Äôt it?

Fastcore (Larm, Septic Death, Siege, Deep Wound, Asocial, early D.R.I)

Essentially, a more raw sounding, faster version of regular hardcore punk with blast beats being utilized 35% of the time within this genre. Fun fact: Blast beats in extreme music was first used in THIS genre, not thrash metal, not black metal, and not death metal. Felt the need that punks here needed to know that. It‚Äôs a known predecessor to Grindcore and Powerviolence.

This is really fucking dead and SO underrapreciated here. I‚Äôll see love for D.R.I pop up a bit, but that‚Äôs for their crossover thrash stuff. Why can‚Äôt we take notice of this style more? Without these bands, so much amazing shit wouldn‚Äôt exist. They‚Äôre important.

Screamo/Emoviolence (Orchid, Pg.99, Jeromes Dream, Saetia, City of Caterpillar, Swing Kids, Combat Wounded Veteran)

An offshoot of emotive hardcore, while the emotive hardcore/post hardcore predecessors avoided the trappings of hardcore punk, screamo bands hailed the latter‚Äôs raw, fast, and aggressive tendencies. (Credit: Now Their Love Is A Ghost on Amino). It can fuse with powerviolence sometimes, making it emoviolence.

You know this subreddit is fucked when the massively influential posterboys of this genre like Orchid and Pg.99 won‚Äôt even surpass 30 upvotes, seriously? I would say this genre is the most influential to punk than the other genres so far. Punks in this subreddit won‚Äôt acknowledge the importance of these bands but everywhere else people will, weird.

Noise Punk/Post-Punk/Post Hardcore (No Trend, Swans, Unwound,, Unsane, Sonic Youth, Big Black, Rapeman, Nation of Ulysses, Christian Death, early Today Is The Day, Bauhaus, The Birthday Party, too many too name)

Like it or not, post punk/noise punk/post hardcore is still 100% as punk as the Ramones or Dead Kennedys. It‚Äôs the same literal foundation, but they did more stuff with the genre and have much more wider influences. These guys‚Äô influences should not be ignored considering Post Punk I‚Äôd say was insanely influential to alternative/indie rock but also metal (Celtic Frost, Metallica, and Entombed loved these type of  bands) and Steve Albini of Big Black and various other bands, is every noise punk and indie rocks dream producer.


Beatdown Hardcore (25 Ta Life, Bulldoze, Neglect, Slugfest, Cast Aside)

Beatdown Hardcore is a sub-genre of Hardcore that grew out of the New York Hardcore scene in the early '90s alongside Metalcore. There is a lot of confusion between these two genres as they are both metallic styles of Hardcore with overlapping features such as a mid-pace tempo groove, tough guy charisma, and fanbase. However, Beatdown Hardcore is strictly a Hardcore sub-genre and not a fusion genre. The main characteristic of Beatdown Hardcore is its thuggish attitude and emphasis on mid-tempo palm-muted riffs akin to Slam Death Metal that occasionally speed up into typical New York Hardcore sections. Oftentimes, the lyrics are street-influenced, focused on crew activity, representation of one's hometown, and lifestyle. (Credit: burningseasonvxse on RYM)

I‚Äôll be fair here and say this genre is pretty much dead from what I know aside from a couple obscure bands keeping it real. But still, is it not hard to say, post a 25 Ta Life song every once in a while, get a lot of upvotes,  see some interesting comments about the beatdown genre or the band? This existed at one point in time and it was pretty important. It can‚Äôt be hard to remember the bands here. After all, isn‚Äôt this what I see in this subreddit? Over glorifying the same classic bands? I think so.

Crust Punk (Amebix, Anti-Cemix, Extreme Noise Terror, Doom, Sacrilege, Disrupt, Hellbastard)

A style of punk very similar to anarcho punk, imagine Crass or any anarcho punk but influenced by the sounds of speed metal, thrash metal, and first wave black metal.

I have a feeling that this subreddit KNOWS these bands are 100% real and 100% punk as fuck. It may be because I assume these 90s pop punk/melodic hardcore lovers don‚Äôt particularly enjoy them or have a narrow view on the genre. If I can see punk bands incorporate harmony and melodic riffs to there sound and get posted here a fuckton, I don‚Äôt see why these Crass lovers that incorporate nasty metal into their framework get posted here

Sludge Metal (Melvins, Eyehategod, Crowbar, later Black Flag, Dystopia, Iron Monkey, Buzzoven)

A doom metal and hardcore punk fusion. A hardcore punk take on say, Black Sabbath.

Man, if none of these bands are punk, neither are the songs from the b side of My War, and if you think that isn‚Äôt, holy shit, you really are reluctant huh? Melvins took huge cues from the likes of Flipper, Black Sabbath and Black Flag. Actually, King Buzzo himself said that they were taking massive influence from Flipper and Black Flag but there‚Äôs ‚Äúless Black Sabbath than you‚Äôd imagine‚Äù (still ain‚Äôt denying the Sabbath influence though). Eyehategod on the other hand, said it themselves that they ripped off Black Flag. and the whole NOLA bands were called Sludgecore. People should accept these bands as punk and need to be more open minded.

Grindcore (Napalm Death, Sore Throat, Repulsion, Pig Destroyer, Nasum, Wormrot)

A fusion of hardcore punk and extreme metal. Take Fastcore/Thrash Metal and have influence from crust punk artists like Electro Hippies and Hellbastard. Napalm Death and Repulsion are cited as the originators of this genre.

It seems like some people here have a pretty poor interpretation of the genre and think stuff like ‚Äúits death metal but super fast, yuck! Not PUNK‚Äù. It has a strong punk philosophy in the lyrics, attitude, song structure, and even throwing punky riffs. The vocals totally have vocals that could be 100% on a crust punk and even on a regular hardcore punk record. I mean just listen to fucking Repulsion, it could totally be on an early punk rock record. It has so much of the attitude honestly. It sounds like a mix between D.R.I and Slayer.
or Napalm Death, a mix of Celtic Frost and Siege, everyone says that. 

I was gonna list off more genres but eh, I think I‚Äôm clear. One of the other reasons I‚Äôm complaining is because it‚Äôs different from r/metal in terms of posting music. They show love for nearly every genre, bands from so many different genres that are different from each other, stuff that can range from post metal (Neurosis) to brutal death metal (Cannibal Corpse). Tons of upvotes and comments at it too. I never see shit like that here. Nothing that can range from Killing Joke to Combat Wounded Veteran. If this subreddit encompases the major appreciation for the genres and bands included, I bet it‚Äôll probably have had just as much as users in r/metal."

In my local scene the bands Press Gang Union and Violent Unrest are donating all of their proceeds today to our local all ages venue which can no longer host shows (said venue is also owned by members of the band Mandolore). If you know of any other bands or venues that need help or know of any other ways we can help please let us know on the comments of this post. Take care of each other and stay safe."

459,punk,punk,"I will admit, it was pop punk bands like Green Day, Blink-182, Sum 41 that got me into punk. Those got me into Pennywise, Bad Religion, then Operation Ivy which put me on to 80s punk (which I mainly only listen to now). I don't really listen to any of my pop punk anymore but I also don't usually delete music (I listen to a lot of genres - rock, rap, r&amp;b, country, blues, etc). Only time I have ever deleted music was when I hit the limit on Spotify. But I have been thinking - punk and...pop, those words aren't really supposed to mix are they? Should I delete all my pop punk?"
2243,punk,poppunkers,"&gt; So am I still waiting  
For this world to stop hating?  
Can't find a good reason  
Can't find hope to believe in 

Derycks probably still waiting lol

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Drop dead  
A bullet to my head  
Your words are like a gun in hand  
You can't change the state of the nation  
We just need some motivation  
These eyes  
Have seen no conviction  
Just lies and more contradiction  
So tell me what would you say  
I'd say it's up to me 

June 2020/BLM

&gt; Ignorance  
And understanding  
We're the first ones to jump in line  
Out of step for what we believe in  
But who's left to stop the bleeding?  
How far  
Will we take this?  
It's not hard to see through the fakeness  
So tell me what would you say  
I'd say it's up to me 

masks

&gt; This can't last forever  
Time won't make things better  
I feel so alone  
Can't help myself  
And no one knows  
If this  
Is worthless  
Tell me (tell me, tell me)  
So  
What have we done  
With a war that can't be won?  
This can't be real  
'Cause I don't know what to feel, no 

The US is fighting against itself. No matter who ""wins"" there will be no ""winner""

It's almost eerie how accurate the lyrics are for today"

935,punk,punk,"I'm always curious on what people have to say on this topic. I don't agree with fascism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. I don't think religion and government should be mixed, I don't believe that anyone should have to conform to what society views as proper, I think people should live their life however the fuck they want, but I am Christian. From my perspective, Christianity is the belief in Jesus, not in the belief in conformity or bigotry. This is my perspective, feel free to share yours."

It's worth noting that his accounts (ahem, aside from being in Rancid, a band that has a lot to say about cops) have shown support of anti-police-brutality and in support of the protests. Also worth noting is that this aired a month ago, before the continent-wide-and-beyond demonstrations started. The organization he donated to services his town's healthcare workers, police, and, as he mentioned specifically, assisted-living facilities. Ultimately, his $20000 contribution will help police, which people in the punk community aren't too happy about. The punks who are staunchly ACAB are going so far as to give up on Rancid and The Used altogether, and I question whether this is fair, even in light of George Floyd's murder. There's still a pandemic on and the PPE that winds up being used by police serves to protect not only themselves, but the people they come in contact with, which actively reduces harm coming from law enforcement agents. What do you think about it?"

So far I've only done 3 songs. I would love some ideas for Song by Band A in the style of Band B. I've done a lot of blink-182 so far since they're my fav band and my voice is a ripoff of Mark Hoppus, but I'd love to hear ideas... if you have any"

For anyone who lives in Denver, The Summit is becoming a favorite of mine for live shows!

Also, side note, there was a handful of elementary-school-age kids there rocking out with their parents and it was badass!"

582,punk,punk,"Hey, guys. I‚Äôve been into punk music since around the same time I got into Nirvana. That was back in middle school, and now I‚Äôm 18. I listen to Ramones, Sex Pistols, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains, Flipper, Buzzcocks, and a lot of other punk/punk influenced bands from the 80s to the 90s, like Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers, Bikini Kill, and Pixies. I come from a pretty conservative family, so I‚Äôm the only one in my house who listens to this kind of music. Naturally, that means I‚Äôve had to discover all of this stuff myself. I recently took the time out to write down every band I listen to, and I noticed that my knowledge of punk music is limited to around 40 or less bands. This made me feel kinda bad, because punk is easily one of my favorite genres, if not my NUMBER ONE favorite genre, and I know there‚Äôs a ton of bands out there that I‚Äôve heard of but I never actually got around to listening to them. So basically, I‚Äôd really love it if you guys could provide me with a list of bands that I can add to the ones I already listen to. I know 40 bands probably sounds like a lot, but when you‚Äôre constantly listening to music like I am, it really isn‚Äôt. I need more. It kinda makes me feel like a poser when I think about it, but I know that‚Äôs just my head getting the best of me. I just want to become more versed in my knowledge of the genre. So yeah, help a fellow punk out. And before I go, Nazi punks fuck off."

It's the same fast melodic punk/hardcore music and it's really almost the same song, especially the rhymes in the verses. There was a toy robot with a ripped heart in the cover or something like that. Silverstein, Close Your Eyes, Seether are good suggestions, but unfortunately no. I think they were a lesser known band.

He survived, but was scarred for life by the events of that morning. The video of his beating quickly spread and became a symbol of police brutality, especially towards minorities.

A legal battle ensued, which ended with the cops that beat him being acquitted.

During the month prior, minorities everywhere were rioting against the cops. They raided stores, set shit on fire, and were basically participating in anarchy (there's a really good Sublime song about the riots  here: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ4q-wQ-w7I](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ4q-wQ-w7I) )

so what exactly is the genre/scene can we name for artists like Lil Lotus, Shinigami, 93feetofsmoke, and Nothing, nowhere?

punk rap? emo rap? trap emo? metal trap?

Other artists like Lil Narnia, Lil Lotus, Shinigami, Fatse, guardin, sadeyes, and countless others are pioneering a new genre that doesn't really have a set categorization yet and it really bothers me bc I really like their kind of music(coming from liking bands like tssf, the wonder years, knuckle puck, neck deep, nfg). It has all the kind of angry/sadness but rather than using live drums/heavy bass they're but using trap beats instead.

So what do you really think of these kinds of a new genre? and what should we call it?

""**For what is a brat** (or prat, can't hear a difference), **what has he got** /

**When he wears hats** and he cannot / 

Say the things he truly feels...""  


I can translate every part of it to my language but it still making no sense at all, who was he refering to? I've read in a community on my language that this part refers to Johnny Rotten, but I highly doubt that, I don't see any signal at all to think that...

1194,punk,punk,"I notice John Lydon gets slammed in this community a lot, but PiL is one of my favorite bands, and while I don't listen to the Sex Pistols much, I think Lydon's lyrics elevated them to a point they wouldn't have reached otherwise. I'd even go so far as to say I am a huge fan of Lydon and while I rarely agree with all of his opinions and admit he can be kind of abrasive and even a downright dick, he's also incredibly witty, entertaining, and innovative, really changing the course of modern music in PiL. He was also the first to call out the commercialization of his first band and rebel against his manager trying to mold him into a specific image to promote to the youth of the time, going so far as to call it out in PiL's first single, Public Image. I don't think he gets enough credit for that, and I also think it's unfair to slag him for doing things like the butter commercial, as after all, we all need to earn a living.  If nothing else, he's always interesting to listen to even if what he says makes me angry, shocked, amused, or laugh. One thing he never fails to do is make me think. So how about a little love for Lydon in this thread, hmm? Any favorite songs or quotes or stories or just times he made you think?"

We on the r/punk mod team are planning on joining the other music subs around reddit in this action. Starting at 9 AM EST tomorrow (Tuesday June 2) This sub will go private for 24 hours. This action should not come as a surprise as punk music has often discussed problems of racial inequality and police violence. We encourage our users to do what they can to fight for justice and spread the message of #blacklivesmatter and #theshowmustbepaused"
3723,poppunkers,poppunkers,"First off, I want to start off by stating that I am a very, VERY big fan of Pop Punk music, as it includes both the hardworking, DIY aesthetic of punk rock with a clean sound that is easily digestible for all audiences. Basically it‚Äôs a genius way for complex thoughts and ideas to be condensed into an easy to swallow format for the general public. I honestly believe that, if all public schooling in the United States was conducted via a series of educational pop punk albums, we‚Äôd be number one in standardized test scores. 

That being said, there is a major problem that plagues the pop punk industry: financial stability. Very few pop punk bands achieve success to a point where they can focus on putting out quality music, without having to worry about their next meal. Since very few share our patricians taste, these pop punk legends will not receive the monetary compensation, and will likely be forced to leave the field of pop punk sometime in their late 20s or whenever their groupies stop being in high school. No doubt financial security is a concern, for both the artist and the artist listener. 

To combat this epidemic, I‚Äôve thought of an idea that *should* assist in the abolition of such woes in the pop punk world. 

Before stating my idea, I‚Äôd like to explain the concept of a ‚ÄúCourt Painter‚Äù. Throughout much of European history, a court painter was, basically, a private artist. Royalty would hire these artists to make paintings of them, and they‚Äôd be paid handsomely solely for making painting for the family. These artists were provided with a living space and a workshop, and had one job: make beautiful pieces of art. It should also be noted that these artists were, essentially, slaves, as they could not leave the premises and had to constantly be working on artwork (sans time allotted for eating and sleeping). I believe this method can still be applied today

Basically, instead of purchasing the albums and merchandise created by bands, we must start purchasing the bands themselves. By purchasing the members of the band, we are able to have them focused on the creation of beautiful pop punk music 24/7, without them having to worry about their personal finances. 

With private pop punk bands, there are many benefits. Lyrics can be written by bands to best reflect your then current mood. Private pop punk bands also perform live whenever you see most fit."

1562,punk,punk,I‚Äôm fairly new to punk and I‚Äôm very interested in the scene and culture! What bands or songs or albums should I listen to to get me started? Thank you :))
1918,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Ok, so there's a song that I found from an Instagram advert and I've been trying to find the name of it. 

It's a song from the label We Are Triumphant
The advert said that the song was part of the 'Pop Punk Essentials' Spotify playlist made by We Are Triumphant

I've been looking through the playlist and all of We Are Triumphant's YouTube channel and I can't seem to find it. 

The video used in the advert had a lot of orange (basically the video had the band members performing the song with a lot of orange stage lights). Also there were a lot a balloons.

The advert starts with one of the band members (I'm assuming the singer) coughing before (what I'm assuming is) the chorus starts

And some of the lyrics I could make out were
'I just wanted you to know'
'Im not doing fine' (or 'we're not doing fine' something about not doing fine)
'I made it out alive' (or 'I made it out on my own')
'Like I do every time'

And then the ad then shows the cover of the Spotify playlist which is someone (on the right) carrying a skateboard in their left hand with graffiti on the wall to the left and in front of them. 
The words 'pop punk' are in white and then the word 'essentials' is in red. 
And that's all I could really figure out. Can someone help me find the name of the song?"

For me, I was fortunate to have a dad that was a punk rocker back in the day with a bunch of battle jackets, shirts, posters, records, and stories. He's still into punk rock actually! 

I also dated a punk rock girl 3 years ago who introduced me to some modern less-known bands and that rekindled my love for punk rock.

I just finished up another listen, and o tried my best to just not think of it as a neck deep album, but as a pop punk album. And you know what? It's... Okay. It's passable. It's still synthetic, and it's still not my ideal taste. But it's not quite as bad as everyone is saying. It's a perfectly fine album, and there's a few proper bangers on there between the mehs"
966,punk,punk,"this will be kinda long, and i would really fuckin appreciate your replies.

im 17, and begun listening to punk music last year. i used to listen to alternative rock, and spent my last two years with metal. with so many family issues and depression, i was bullied and other shit. classmates and others at school would say i wasnt worth communicating and i was so low on self esteem. i had these classmates which would talk about bands and i would just wanna talk with them so bad, but if i did they would just joke about it like ""who knew this girl would know these songs, haha"". (my english is just too bad
..sorry) they had really big prejudice about my physcial appearence which made me feel worse. 
anyways, there were two ""punks"" in my classroom last year and weren't that nice to me, i wasnt sure how id call myself but i loved punk music too. later, with a fake id, i met lots of people online and ive got friends i still talk to. i still use that account and because of quarantine, some of my online friends decided to open new chat groups, and in one of them there is also these two classmates from earlier. 
till that group was created, i just wish i would go to another city in university and as i would be 18, i could go to concerts and make friends. but now i kinda realize that almost all the ""punks"" i knew till today were into alcohol, drugs and smoking. (those two would say i was such a innocent baby cause i didnt smoke)
i dont care about people drinking near me and the reason why i cant is my health issues. but in friend groups everyone is smoking and drunk, my head is full of thoughts... i was also bullied about am i muslim or not which im not religous at all, i just have pills i gotta take which even if i wouldnt have, why would i have to? 
there are so many threads about 'you dont have to dress black wear converse and other shit just feel punk'  but what about smoking and alchocol? 
(i know straight edge as a hardcore subgenre but its also called muslimcore here which brings everything back to religion)"
1310,punk,punk,I am new to the punk scene and I agree with a lot of the views and want to voice them. The only issue is I have a fear of getting in trouble and will often have an anxiety attack when faced with it. Any advice?

Idea is simple.  [Join the FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/262940581728341/).  When you have a new release post it.  Get feedback from other bands.  If a band digs your release it's encouraged that they post it on their social giving you exposure to their actual fans.  Let's create a positive ecosystem and help each other out.

Btw, I only used FB because it's an easy platform to post and share on.  Open to other suggestions."

They had a sound like no one else at the time and singing about heroin and bondage in the 1960s in my opinion is pretty punk.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/hvfphj)"
201,punk,punk,"Hardcore is more than music. Its a cliche, but its true. Hardcore has helped me through 2 addictions, mental health issues, family issues (im not kidding when I say im a Kyle), and from suicide. Hardcore has been a genre for over 40 years, and in that time it has never ""peaked"" or died, unlike every other genre of heavy music (arguably all music) in the last 50 year's. It has a community that makes it so impactful on so many people's lives. Its the reason if you go to a show you'll see both angsty teenagers at shows and guys in their 40s who have been going to shows since their teens. When i was first getting into hardcore, around 15-16 i just figured they liked the music.

 I started to understand once i actually started to deal with stuff. It was late in my sophomore year, and i needed to pass ( i dont come from a great town, and my family doesn't have money), and for about 3 weeks, i stayed up until 2 or 3AM every night, fueled by my snorted medication, and hardcore. I listened to the classics, like black flag and minor threat, and newer stuff like restraining order and Pears. Before this, i listened to it but didnt really care about the message, but during those long nights I started to understand the anger and dedication of the music, and started to pay attention to the lyrics.¬† 

Then shit started to happen in my life, and i started to understand why people listened to hardcore for decades. You see, im autistic. To make a long story short, for years i viewed autism like i was taught, as a disease. This led to extreme self doubt and depression. And it was around this time, early 2019 that i developed a addiction to focalin, the medication i was prescribed, which i originally snorted to do homework better. I started to snort it more and more to try and cover up my issues. It worsened and worsened over the summer, during which i went to my first show. 

I remember at my first show. It was August 27, and I was standing outside of an elks lodge, which i was told was called ""hardcore stadium"" (which, admittedly makes it sound much more impressive than it really is)i was terrified, thinking my social anxiety would be crippling (just keep in mind that i got bad anxiety buying gum at a store), but instead, the opposite happened, and i finally understood why hardcore meant so much to people.¬† For the first time in years i felt safe in my skin. I could stim (fidgeting that autistic people to calm down), without feeling like a retard, i felt safe in a hot, cramped basement full of people who terrified me at first. The noise and cramped, hot basement didn't make me panic, it made me feel the safest and most comfortable i had felt in years. The sense of community is unlike anything I had experienced. I could be who i was, and not be judged or hated for it. That idea wouldnt fully set in for another few months unfortunately, but hey at least i got it eventually

Im just realizing that this is more about me than hardcore (my bad, ill try to make it more than just me), but anyway back to my crippling addiction. School had started back up, and all the people who i had called ""friends"" were in other classes. I also got my prescription doubled, and i figured out how to make alcohol. This led to a month and a half of heavy pill use and drinking, which almost killed me several times. Looking back, i realize that i was attempting to deal with the consequences of repressing my identity, both autism and homosexuality. During this time, i stopped listening to hardcore, calling it ""too pc"", (yeah I had pretty terrible views on society. i was going down the path of reactionary thinking. I never got to far down the path, but i was still a POS, and led me to being really homophobic, transphobic and anti pc). During this time, i would frequently overdose, (which in one occasion led to psychosis, that had me seeing maggots crawling in my skin) get into fights with my parents, and the few people who i got got along with cut me off. 

Then i got clean, (dont worry im getting back to hardcore) and it was during this time that i got away from my toxic mindset of self hatred and hateful thinking. I realized that my identity (the autism anyway) wasnt something to be fixed. I remember being alone, sober, still getting into fights with my parents, and the only thing that was there for me was hardcore. The only place i felt accepted for who i am was in the cramped, hot basements and back rooms of hardcore shows. For once, i was told to think for myself, and not to hide it. (I know how cringey that sounds, i apologize). I remember at the release show for vantage point's ep ""an answer you wont find"" (great ep btw), the vocalist of vantage point saying in between songs (roughly, my memory aint great) ""shoutout too all the people who are struggling every day to be independent, to stay free, and not suck off some corporation."" And i remember this line vividly, because thats exactly what it felt i had been doing for all these years. Not corporations, but the mental health system. 

So yeah. To an outsider it may just seem cringey (and it is, but not due to the music genre) and like the music had nothing to do with it, just like the scene kids did back in 2010. But I assure you this is different. Hardcore bands arent motivated by money, cuz if they were they would play literally any genre outside of hxc/ extreme metal. They play the music out of their passion for the music and culture. That genuine passion is what has kept the genre alive for almost 40 years, from minor threat in 83, to gulch just a few weeks ago. 

Anyway, after that came the worst phase of my life *the scene phase*. yes i listened to scene music in 2019, and no i don't want to talk about it. Moving on, there's not much to say. My life is way better now, largely in thanks to hardcore. Its always there to support you, (and knock sense into you if your a pos like I was). 

So yeah, the statement, ""hardcore is more than music"" is cringey, but it doesn't make not true. What seems like just a bunch of angry guys in basements is really an entire culture. A culture that accepts people, as long as they arent RAC or simaler, and gives them a place to feel comfortable. I dunno, i might be entirely wrong as well, but hey it's probably a mistake to post this anyway but ive already written it all, and its about time I contribute this sub more than just making jokes about me punching my dad. Also, once shows start back up again, and you see me at a show, come over and say hi! (Im the tall white kid akwardly pacing and fidgeting in the back)"

Basically me and a friend have been trying to find the name of punk rock band lead singer that had long wavy hair and bangs and was beat to death in a bathroom by their bandmate that had a blonde mohawk while they were both high at an after party. We managed to somewhat narrow it down to having happened in the United States, but aside from that, were having trouble coming up with anything else. Some details may be off as this was purely based off the recollections of said friend.

One other detail that may be a distinguishing factor, the person in question had their face slammed into the sink.

The band they were a part of was fairly small and lesser known apparently.

393,punk,punk,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the most appropriate place to post this, but over the past few months, the owners of ‚ÄúThe Last Chance Rock &amp; Roll Bar‚Äù in Melbourne, Australia, have been very vocal about how much the COVID-19 Lockdowns have affected their business. 

If you‚Äôre from Melbourne, or anywhere else in the world, and have had the pleasure of attending this venue, you‚Äôll understand what I mean when I say it feels like home. Punk and Rock memorabilia decorate the old walls, and the faint smell of beer and sweat from many previous mosh pits, burn your nostrils in the most inviting way. 

This place is a staple in the music scene in our beautiful city, giving many young artists the shot that not many other venues would. This place has the most DIY, balls to wall, F*** You We‚Äôll do it anyway kind of attitude, but despite the fight that they‚Äôve put up, without the generosity and help of Music fans from all over, they‚Äôre not going to make it through this second COVID lockdown that‚Äôs just been imposed on our city. 

I know that times are tough for everybody right now, but if you can, please consider giving to one the most deserving venues in the world. Throw your arms around your fellow punk brothers and sisters, and let‚Äôs not let another awesome venue fall.

Song A:

Song B (not finished):

i might try refine it a bit, cuz it sounds like 2010 live Tom Delonge a bit too much for me sometimes, but i love having the grit in the voice.

2169,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I know they set such a high bar with Adornment, so I was just wondering what people thought of their follow up. I absolutely love the album. Might not reach the highs of Adornment, but I feel like I've listened to it more as a whole. It's just such a good album to throw on and listen to from start to finish. While Adornment touched on serious topics with a more serious sound, I found it so refreshing they still touched on similar topics, but did it with an upbeat sound that it's actually a fun listen. Just don't see it talked about much."
2582,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I found this pretty interesting... Does anybody remember Hawk Nelson from back in the day? They had (what I think are) two really great pop-punk records come out: Letters To The President (2003) and Smile, It's the End of the World (2006). I was 13 and 16 when they came out so maybe me being young had something to do with me liking them more because they were pretty polarizing for being one of those Christian bands that's not, but definitely is. You know what I mean? Like, ""We're not a Christian band; we're Christians in a band,"" like MxPx or Five Iron Frenzy. So that meant the punk scene didn't always like them because they were too Christian and the Christian scene didn't always like them because they were too punk... 

Anyway, I liked those two albums even though i look back at them now as the poor man's MxPx. Well they put out five records total from 2003 up until 2013 as the pop punk group and then frontman Jason Dunn left the band, the guitarist Jon Steingard was moved up from lead guitars to frontman and they rebranded a contemporary CCM (Christian contemporary) group. It was so strange, but by the time they did that I had long quit listening. I remember giving their third and fourth album each a listen and being underwhelmed. I still dig those first two. If nothing more, they're nostalgic.

Which brings me to why I'm posting and wondering if any of you know anything about any of this. I remember Jason leaving so abruptly and couldn't tell if it was actually amicable or if it was just positive ""don't burn bridges"" PR from both sides... I just remembered all of this for some reason and tried to do some digging and can't find anything. Jason doesn't follow any of the original members or new members of Hawk Nelson on Instagram and none of them follow him. Even more bizarre considering that I know Daniel Biro, the bassist and only original member left, was a groomsman in Jason's first wedding and Jason was one in his. I just find that so odd and wonder if any of you remember any of this or have any info."

They are a hair metal band and that's fine, but I don't see how there music is punk.

1075,punk,punk,"I‚Äôm going to post this in several places each month until I solve this.  
PLEASE Do not attempt to find this person. Already some one has been involved that is not the person from the incident. This is only for if you are this person or know her so that you can tell her.  

Ok, story time.September 18th, 2016, I was at Riot Fest in Chicago. I was there, presumably the same as you, to see The Misfits. Early on in the show (even though they were the headliners the sun was still up when this incident happened,) I was in the mosh pit closer to stage left. If I recall the song playing was ‚ÄúDie, Die, My Darling,‚Äù but I‚Äôm fuzzy on that.   
So there I was, moshing it up, and you got spun out from a pretty wicked hit. You ended up standing somewhat facing me, and your eyes rolled back, you staggered, and collapsed.   
You came close to hitting the ground headfirst and were about to be trampled but I managed to catch you before full impact. You were unconscious and non responsive. I managed to lift you, put you on my shoulder, and get you off the ground. Knowing there was no way I would be able to carry you all the way back out through the pit to emergency services, I carried you towards the stage and fought my way up there all the way to security.   
I handed you over the railing to them screaming to call you an ambulance. They dragged you off past the stage, and that‚Äôs the last time I saw you.  
I made a Craigslist Missed Connection about you the next day. Unsurprisingly it didn‚Äôt get a response. For some reason I think about you sometimes and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here today.  
I don‚Äôt want or deserve any thanks or reward. It‚Äôs just for some reason I think every now and then and wonder what happened. Did you get out ok? Find whatever friends you were there with? Get rushed to the hospital? Did you even survive? You looked pretty roughed up and I still have the bloodstain in my jacket.   
Wouldn‚Äôt wash out.  
From what I remember about you, because I didn‚Äôt get too good of a look and it was close to four years ago now:Short, about 5‚Äô3‚Äù no taller than 5‚Äô5‚Äù. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and there‚Äôs no way I could‚Äôve picked up and carried a larger person that far through a mosh pit. I am not that strong.  
Brown hair, shoulder length.  
Hazel eyes.  
I know you had jeans on, and a lower cut band shirt on. I don‚Äôt remember what band but I want to say maybe Anti-Flag?  
I just really hope you made it out ok. It was particularly relevant at the time because I‚Äôd heard a story about a show that week where a dude got trampled to death in a pit. I just hope you didn‚Äôt do the same.  

I decided to add a FAQ section.  
Q:Hey bro you just desperate to get with this girl!A: I‚Äôm in a something that I think will be great. Not a relationship at this time but I really enjoy the person I‚Äôm talking to. Q: Why try to find her?A: Because for some reason I still worry about her and I hope she ended up ok. I also have a personal question I‚Äôd like to ask her.Q: Was it a great show?A: it was fucking awesome."

I played all parts and this album took the better part of a year to make. The album is a story about a dude who hates his job, loves his friends, meets a girl, falls for her, realizes she's not who he thought she was, spins out of control in self pity only to find a path of self redemption.

I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did making it :)"

3596,poppunkers,poppunkers," Alright, so I finished my Taylor Jardine fan fiction. Before you all go and talk shit about band fan fiction, you have to acknowledge mine is way better than all those other wannabes. Check it out.  
There I stood alone in the cold. It was about 45 minutes after the We Are The In Crowd 2014 reunion tour show in Toronto. I had an awesome time.  
All of the bands were amazing and Tay was looking extra sexy tonight in her cute pink Paramore tee. I knew it probably wasn't the best weather to be standing around in, with it being February in Canada, but luckily I was bundled up with my TSSF crewneck underneath my winter jacket and my cozy Attila pants. I was so determined on meeting Tay that nothing else really mattered that night.  
""You're not going to see her, just give it up"", my friend told me before he left to go back to the hotel.  
""No, I have to stay, this means alot to me"", I told him.  
I began to think that maybe my friend was right and that I was just wasting my time until I saw a small girl from the distance as she walked toward me.  
""That can't be Tay, can it?"", I thought to myself.  
She got a bit closer and I realized it was her. Her wavy brown hair, her beautiful eyes, her sexy curves which were distinguishable even in her winter attire. My heart started to beat faster in my chest and I started to feel a bit jittery.  
""Hey I'm sorry about this but can I use your phone?"" She asked. ""Mine just died and I have to make an important call. Were you at the show""?  
It took me a couple seconds to process what was happening and I muttered out a soft ""Yeah.""  
I quickly pulled myself together and then blurted out ""it's so nice to meet you, I'm such a big fan, this is truly an honor"".  
She blushed and said ""thanks man!"" in her unbearably cute tone.  
I said to her ""before you use my phone, can I have a picture with you though?""  
She said ""sure!"".  
I was like ""sweet, now I'll have a picture with the two cutest pop-rock singers, you and Jenna from Tonight Alive!"".  
""Well, I'm not too sure I could compete with Jenna"", she said.  
""I've always preferred brunettes actually"", I said back to her.  
She giggled and smiled. I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone out and watched my dreams shatter before my eyes as I realized that my phone battery had died.  
I blurted out ""Oh man!"".  
She was like ""what's wrong?"".  
""My phone's dead"", I said.  
She said, ""I'll tell you what. Come onto my bus and we'll charge both our phones and you can take that picture with me"".  
I responded ""really? you'd take me on your bus?""  
She said, ""sure thing, it's the least I can do for a fan who waited 45 minutes in the cold to meet me"".  
My face lit up with excitement.  
We walked a couple of blocks until we got to her bus.  
As we walked inside, I was surprised to find out that the bus was empty.  
""Where's the rest of the band?"" I asked.  
""Oh they went to go hang out with Set It Off."" she said.  
""That's cool"", I responded.  
We sat down next to each other on one of the couches and she started to scoot closer to me.  
""Shouldn't you be finding your charger?"" I asked.  
""I just remembered that Jordan has it"", she responded.  
I said ""oh that's cool, so now what?"".  
She leaned in closer. My heart started to beat fast. I began to get sweaty in the palms.  
""Don't be so nervous"", she said as she leaned in to give me a kiss.  
I kissed her and then I immediately pulled back.  
""Do you have a boyfriend?"" I asked.  
""Sort of. Things are complicated"", she responded.  
""That doesn't sound too good"", I said.  
""Kiss me again"", she whispered in my ear.  
""Kiss me again... like the We Are The In Crowd Song?"", I asked.  
We both laughed.  
""You're such a dork"", she said.  
Suddenly I hear a loud noise as someone entered the tour bus. I begin to panic and then I see that it's Derek from State Champs, one of the opening bands on the tour.  
""Derek, what's up man?"", I said, ""awesome set tonight"".  
""What the fuck are you doing with my girlfriend?"" he asked me in an angry tone.  
I said ""Huh? Taylor is your girlfriend? I had no idea"".  
""Yeah"", he said, ""and you've got your hands all over her"".  
""Slow down buddy, she came onto me"", I said in defense.  
""She came onto you? Why the fuck would she want you? You're just some dumb fanboy. I'm the lead vocalist for one of the best up and coming crewneckcore bands."" he responded aggressively.  
""Calm down man. Look, I've got alot of respect for you. The Finer Things was in heavy rotation on my iPod last November. I don't want any conflict"".  
""Derek, I have something to tell you"", Taylor quickly budded in.  
""What?"", he asked.  
""This is what I was going to tell you over the phone if Jordan hadn't taken my charger but I'll just say it to your face... we're through"".  
""What?! You're breaking up with me? Why?"" he responded, sounding upset and confused.  
""I read about that stuff you did with that girl on the internet"", Taylor said.  
""But baby, that wasn't real, it was fan fiction"", he told her.  
""I don't care, we're done."" she said.  
""Fucking fangirls"", Derek muttered to himself as he walked off the bus."

Someone named Ramy who seemed like some kind of journalist and farrah a well known punk photographer/activist from the dc area. For me i actually learned a lot from the conversation (being a white male) and saw the issue, but also i did feel bad for Nader as it seems he is not being fully supported in his new endeavor from the punk community and even said he feels that Arabs in the united states are not given a sense of identity.

I'd kill for an Orange head/cab setup but don't currently have the budget for something like that. Are the Orange combo amps any good?"

3340,poppunkers,poppunkers,"This may have been discussed before, I know for sure the topics have individually.  

I guess I'll get it out of the way that I guess I'm getting old and a lot of the new pop punk bands just don't seem to have the same high energy feel I love.  But some of my favorites especially the older ones from the height of the scene have all been active.

New Releases from: The Wonder Years,  A Day to Remember,  New found glory, and Four Year Strong.  On top of that Simple Plan and NFG announced the ""Pop Punk's Not Dead"" tour.  I'm really hoping to see some tour dates within driving distance with the scene seeming to take off again.  

And getting optimistic here but there's been rumors of Tom Delonge reuniting with Blink 182.  While I'm not too excited about that since Blink hasn't had the same feel in later albums, I'm hoping that frees up Matt for more Alkaline Trio tour dates."

3610,punk,poppunkers,"Hey everyone! I just started my new semester in college and I am taking an elective course called Rock'n'Roll and Society and it goes over the history of rock music and how it has impacted music and culture.

I am looking through the syllabus and I see that the final project will be to give a presentation with written support and a listening guide about an artist/band whom I think should be discussed in our text book 20 years from now.

With pop punk being my current favorite genre, I was curious as to who this community thinks that artist should be. Thoughts?"

1212,punk,punk,"I‚Äôve been a fan of punk music and culture ever since I was a kid but recently I‚Äôve been to myself about anarchism. Before this I never thought much about anarchism but now the more I think about it, the more it seems unrealistic due to the fact that it would cause people to go crazy instead of abiding by ‚Äúnatural human rights‚Äù like we would want them to. I‚Äôve found that government is necessary, and that ideologies that lack government like Anarchism or Marxism seem like they‚Äôd never work in the real world. 

Also this may be very un-punk of me, but I like how Capitalism gives people choice and allows for people (like in the punk scene) to start their own businesses without having to work for someone else. An ideal government for me would involve everybody fulfilling the needs of every other but still allowing for private ownership to fill the wants of people. Not sure if this is even possible or if there is a name for this however."

I've been to a few live shows - went to slam dunk festival last year and another pop/punk festival and whilst I've enjoyed myself I feel like I haven't been able to appreciate it because I don't know any of the words (and I struggle hard with making out what someone is singing live if I don't already know it).

418,punk,punk,"This place has become a toxic mire of gatekeeping and hive-mindedness.  Every day it seems there's a new post declaring what is and what isn't punk, and any who disagree need to fuck off and die.  This is bullshit, and it's the same fucking trope that the other side uses to declare their superiority over people who look or act different.

I got into this life because I was young and angry, and this music and it's people were the exact same way.  Unlike my high school, when I walked through the doors of Gilman nobody called me a faggot because I wore a kilt or had a stupid green haircut.  Nobody cared what you looked like, but everyone understood *why* you looked that way.  Society told us how we were supposed to look and act, and we in turn gave society the finger and did whatever the fuck we wanted to do anyway.

Yes, Michael Graves is a piece of shit and a waste of air.  Yes, facism, nazism, ultra-conservatism, all this shit has to go.  But telling someone they can't fight alongside you because they aren't punk enough is just plain fucked, and that makes you no better than them. 

If you want to be on the front lines for what you believe, I say Vive la Resistance!  If you want to get your aggression out in the pit, I'll be there to pick you up and throw you back out there.  Hell, if you just want to listen to pop-punk love songs all day that's your thing and I will make damn-sure that you can listen in peace.

1601,poppunkers,punk,that 98 post got me thinking about 99. best albums and tracks whatever.
891,punk,punk,"...settlers conspired with African community leaders to enslave a generation

On the second day, we beat slaves mercilessly and their only escape from the beatings was singing spirituals with each other.  

On the third day, they weaved worried notes together into what we now know as the blues as a way to express their anguish.

On the fourth day, they continued to take our beatings and gave us rock and roll. 

On the 5th day, rock and roll reached new ears and anarchy spread to the UK. Soon after it took a long boat ride back to So Cal. 

On the 6th day, we had punk rock. We gave them 526 seconds of knee to the back of the neck. 

What are you gonna do tomorrow? After how much the black community has positively effected our lives isn't it our turn to positively effect theirs? If a song has ever saved your life then you owe your life to the black community. 

On the 7th day, can you really afford to rest when the people who have given us so much are hurting so badly? 

We always have this stupid fucking circular argument about what is and isn't punk. This is the one time where it's not up for debate. If you don't support our brothers and sisters right now while they fight for true freedom you have no business calling yourself punk. You're just wearing someone else's leather jacket and ripped jeans

Part of being punk is realizing that our culture, our identity was in part literally beaten out of African Americans. Without African American Spirituals there would be no London Calling. Without the blues there would be no Suburban Home or Hope. Without Rock and Roll there would be no American Jesus. 

Black culture is American culture. Opposing oppression is what true patriotism looks like. #blacklivesmatter

And she was like a starry night

eyes are glowing to my beating heart

You were as priceless as can be

When you smile, I melt inside

Is it cool if I hold your hand?

Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?

Long hair that blows side to side

You speak and make time stand still

And each time you walk right on by

Do you like my stupid hair?

Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?

I'm too scared of what you think

I'm not worthy for a minute of your time

She's cool, she's my friend

I would wish upon a star

She's all I'm always wanting

she's all I dream

And I want her, need her

Maybe I'll win her heart

Honest, let's make this night last forever

Forever and ever, let's make this last forever"

Somewhere out there I know there is a pop punk tune that had ""and on, and on, and on, and on"" in the chorus. Words could have been different but that's what it sounded closest to. I saw a subreddit of this song on a different feed from 4 years ago recently and was inspired.

That way when they come for you, you bought your own handcuffs.

1025,punk,punk,"Hello from ""Crusty Craig"" (Boston DIY punk show organizer 1993- late 2000's)

These days I travel the world speaking with people about how to choose love (and love yourself), how to live a better way, how to be forgiving, how to accept others, how to have empathy, how to accept all experiences as necessary and educational, spirituality, sexual liberation, fighting for what matters,  standing up for marginalized people, and much more.

This photo is of a flyer from an event I did on the Greek island of Corfu. I decided I wanted to enter Greece by boat so I did. I literally traveled for 12 hours by bus, from Kosovo, to get to the Albanian coast to take a ferry to be able to do this.

Most people don't know much about me even those who know me from back home. I'm a hardcore survivor.

I left Massachusetts and the United States, for very serious reasons, and by getting away I was able to begin to become the man I was born to be.

I've published two books and I'm about to publish three more.

I admit that I'm a hurt person, and I also admit that I know that I'm a walking miracle.

I have no time for bullshit. I survived all I did to do good in the world. Most people who know what happened to me know that I'm an anomaly for surviving.

I have stories and information to share that will both benefit my own life and benefit thousands of others.

If there are people anywhere who are journalists or work in radio or media of any sort, big or small, or have positions of influence, and you want to change the world for the better, get in touch with me if you want to talk. If you want to find out more about the books I published, let me know directly; I would definitely be benefited from the support.

Thank you,  
Craig

1219,punk,punk,"This is a legit question, does ACAB call for the destruction of the police system or for a reform of it? And who does it apply to like just beat cops or anyone who works under it (like detectives, those who work on the scientific side, ect). I think the legal system is absolutely terrible in how it treats people and I don‚Äôt support police brutality/ICE/anything of that sort, but I‚Äôm curious to what it has to say on the aspects of people who work under them but work on cases that involve r**p/human trafficking/violent crimes. 

The career I‚Äôm personally aiming for is criminal profiling because I want to help to bring the legitimate guilty to justice and I want to know if there is any moral problems with that since I‚Äôm questioning if I should keep aiming for that.

The quarantine has me going through all my old CDs and I finally got all of these together in one place (but they aren‚Äôt organized in any way, that‚Äôll be a later project). These are mostly pop punk and the two columns on the right are mainly compilations. 

I‚Äôve seen about 3/4 of these bands live. I was actually at the Lagwagon Live in A Dive show which was at House of Blues in Hollywood on Sunset Blvd (no longer there). I lived in LA during the late 90s and early 2000s when a lot of these bands were in their heyday, so they‚Äôd always be playing the local venues! Great memories. Just thought I‚Äôd share"

I don't believe michale graves is a racist or a white supremacist , I believe he was just saying shit to be a prick . I have met him personally and had a conversation with him , and I can vouch that he knows how to articulate his words and his talking points . Anyone who has met the guy along with me , loki , ect knows hes a very nice guy and goes out of his way to meet fans and sign autographs. 
Today on lokis ( michales guitar player ) livestream he addresses the matter and said that michale usually articulates his talking points and that it's odd for him to not give any rhyme or reason to say the stuff he said , he said michale was just saying stuff just to piss people off and be a troll . Hes always nice to interviewers and fans so why would he just alienate his own audience on purpose???? 
I propose a theory that michale graves (ex misfits) was LITERALLY SHITPOSTING on his Instagram just to be a prick , I mean why else would a guy who usually explains why he says things to not explain anything. He really was trying to go out of his way to piss people off and be a prick. Or that's what I think anyway."

I‚Äôll tell why you‚Äôre wrong.


I feel like this movie is super tight. It came out at the right time 1998 going into 99 was before punk became totally totally digitized and mainstreamized like a few years after in the 00s. 

I can‚Äôt disagree with most of their beliefs. 

Steveos analysis is the best I‚Äôve seen in any punk film which outside of the the 80s ones is usually just superficial and surface level stuff about Anarcho punks or drinking, concert going or adventures. 

His breakdown of the 80s scene, chaos and anarchy, philosophy, lifestyle and beliefs  isn‚Äôt actually bullshit and illogical. 

Even the fashion is spot on. People mixed up flannel or button up shirts with funky or everyday clothing. It wasn‚Äôt always a band shirt etc 

It‚Äôs pretty accurate. Maybe a few things were a bit off towards the end but it‚Äôs super solid. 

There were well established authors ( individualist and ontological anarchists) who mix chaos and anarchy together or as the same  giving what his particular brand of anarchism is some merit. Also the way he broke it down is pretty solid.

Look up TAZ ( CHAOS the broadsheets of ontological anarchism) 

The only part is the way the subculture is downplayed towards the end is a bit cheap
and the reasoning of anarchy essentially representing what they were fighting against. 

Also bobs acting is a bit questionable at times."

Pretty Odd was a (in retrospect) beautiful album, but imo lacks the iconicry of Fever. Aside from ""Nine In The Afternoon"" and maybe ""Northern Downpour"", there really aren't any songs that truly stand out. V&amp;V was even less than that, as barely anyone truly acknowledges the album as a whole, TWTLTRTD is regarded by many as a bad album (even though i like it), and even though their last two albums, Death of A Bachelor and Pray For The Wicked, went to #1 and even gave Brendon his most successful song, they're just a mess in terms of quality. So in conclusion, I personally feel that P!ATD never topped their debut album.

147,punk,punk,"I'm on holiday with my mother and I brought my boyfriend with me. We were supposed to spend some days in a place in the mountains so we brought some weed with us that we stashed in his bag and, since my mother is a cop, we locked it for safe keeping.
She found out anyway because she caught my bf rolling a joint in our room, so obviously she got really angry and I wasn't expecting anything different but she surprised me.

She chose her job over me and the person I'm in love with: after she threw away the weed, the papers and the tobacco (which wasn't necessary since it's legal and she knows I used to smoke cigs) she actually threatened me to call the cops on my bf (he's 19) and shouted at me that she could lose her job and that she has arrested people for fewer grams. Then, she said the worst things about him and me and how I care more about weed than her losing her job. She doesn't give a fuck that I smoke it, even if she thinks it's the herb of the devil, she just care about her fucking job and money.
Cops can fuck you over even if it's the person that gave birth to you.

Sorry for the long story but It's an experience I'll never forget and I think it's worth a reading.

Anyway, all of this to ask you for the angriest songs/playlists you like about smashing cops, the punkest graphics I can copy on my jacket and anything else you might think could make me love not being like my mother.

228,punk,punk,"First of all I guess I should define the term as I understand it... it generally means any musical genre where the borders are being pushed and expanded by incorporating new sounds, arrangements, influences, etc. In practice it often means more complex time signatures, jazz and classical influences and a strong emphasis on instrumentation and soloing. I know part of the origin story of Punk was rebelling against the pretentious and overblown bands that where filling arenas at the time, and many of these where progressive rock bands. 

So is there a genre of Punk that has kinda gone back and picked up prog elements? I can kinda feel it a little in like New Wave and Post Punk but I'm also not a musician. I also know that Serj Tankian is a progressive musician and he seems to straddle Metal and Punk as influences of his.    


I know a lot of genres are mirrored in Metal and Punk or even straight up overlap... is there a prog punk genre by that or any other name? 

I know genre omnivores who listen to 'a little bit of everything' might have an easier time figuring out what I'm clumsily asking but still pretty curious."
654,punk,punk,Pop punk isn‚Äôt some evil anti punk. It‚Äôs just punk that appeals to a wider demographic and that‚Äôs fine. Some punks would like to believe that it‚Äôs somehow a bad thing because a lot of people like it. I think those punks might want to go to a hospital because they‚Äôve got a five foot long stick shoved up their ass. Punk isn‚Äôt some exclusive little club that only you are allowed to be in because you‚Äôre so special. Just because a song doesn‚Äôt talk about killings cops and dismantling society doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be punk. If a band focuses on sexual frustration or mental illness or abusive relationships then they‚Äôre still punk. Also there‚Äôs nothing wrong with something that appeals to a lot of people. Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre so damn special that you‚Äôre above liking things that everyone else likes.

2379,poppunkers,poppunkers,"&gt;**Will Clarke**, owner of **Prana Recording Studio** Agency in Atlanta, GA has contributed to this article.

# 1. Practice your songs to a click

Unless you are recording a LIVE album, practicing your music to a metronome makes overdubbing or any sort of correction in **Post-Production** incredibly easy. I know many engineers that will not record without a click simply to avoid the headache. If your musical group has music (*or a drummer*) that fluctuates between tempos, you need to rehearse the music to per-determined **BPM** before showing up to your session.

# 2. Show up Prepared

My opinion is: A great studio session is one that runs quickly and efficiently. If you and your band mates are pressured into last minute problems or troubleshooting (*such as vocal delivery, guitar melody, or rhythm section misalignment*), it can be a real strain on the recording process.

If you are looking to become a session musician, remember this saying: ***You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared.***

# 3. Recording a Song is like building a house

Before you even get to work on the house, you spend hours designing and planning. This is the **Pre-Production Phase**. Finally, you are ready to bring a construction crew to your site of choice‚Ä¶ This is your arrival at the Studio. You put down the foundations first, within the context of the greater plan of the house. This is why drums and bass are the first to record, within the context of a scratch guitar or melody track. Next, you put up walls and a roof, essentially closing off the creative box in which you will work. This is the main identifying characteristic of the song (or house), such as lead melodies and vocals, or lead guitar. From there, you add finishing touches ‚Äî nice railings on the stairs, windows, drywall, insulation, and paint. These are finer details that reinforce the greater creative goal of the song, such as vocal harmonies, horn lines, solo sections, time-based effects, percussion, and texture.

### From my experience, I like to organize my **Recording Process** like this:

1. **Drums + Bass**
2. **Pad** (Rhythm Guitar + Keys) ‚Äî OR
3. **Melody** (Vocals, guitar, keys, whichever instrument is playing the melody)
4. **Harmony** (Horn section, backing vocals, etc)
5. **Texture** (ambience, percussion, overdubs)

And then of course at any time, any and all of these elements can be re-recorded (*exception here:* ***drums***), edited, moved around, spliced, played backwards, etc.

# 4. You can always add reverb and delay, but it is impossible to get rid of.

Most likely, your mix engineer will add reverb and delay properly. However, some artists are adamant that they know best:

### Scenario 1:

Let‚Äôs say you are in a Dream Pop band that has vocals running through a highly saturated vocal effects pedal. Your singer absolutely nails the take of the chorus, except for one thing: the singer accidentally smacks the microphone with their hand because of their \*sick dance moves\*. If you are only recording the vocal signal **wet** (*with effects*) as opposed to **dry** (*without effects*), not only are you recording the physical smack of the microphone, but you also are recording the 2 seconds of reverb that comes after. If you recorded Dry, you can easily edit out the hit and saturate the dry vocals with effects in Post. But if you recorded Wet, this becomes a brutal challenge for even the best engineer.

Mixing Engineers agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove any amount of reverb or delay on a recorded instrument. Which is why we record dry signals and send the performer a wet signal in their monitor mixes. We make separate tracks for important, time-based effects like reverb and delay, and give those effects their own adjustable levels and parameters for real-time monitoring without affecting the integrity of the dry vocal track.

### Scenario 2:

You are the keyboard player of an indie rock band and you are playing a Rhodes. The built in tape delay on your Korg SV1 Keyboard is pretty great! So, you slap it on. Turns out, your delay timing is too long and too prominent in the context of the mix. Unfortunately, in this scenario there is nothing the engineer can do to fix that. ***With any and all time-based effects, you want to start small and build big, or use none at all***. You can always re-amp the clean signal or re-record the instrument with effects to taste.

# 5. Re-amp your guitars for the perfect tone

### Scenario 3:

You are in a Heavy Metal Band. Your guitar player take a 4 bar solo before the Pre-Chorus Breakdown. The amount of Gain and Distortion on this solo must be absolutely Perfect ‚Äî and while your effects may be incredibly dialed in to your ear, the Engineer always has a different perspective. So the Engineer will split the recording process into two parts:

**Re-Amping** is a non-destructive process of recording a clean tone (usually through a DI box straight from the Guitar) and then re-recording that clean signal into a guitar amp &amp; Pedal effects separately over top of the song at a later time. This gives the band and Engineer the opportunity to fine-tune the gain, distortion, compression and any other effects to perfection without compromising the initial take.

[DI Box](https://i.imgur.com/Fmr88Jt.jpg)

Many engineers split the initial guitar tone and record both a **wet** &amp; **dry** signal, especially in genres of heavily affected guitars (*like Metal, Rock and Roll, Pop, &amp; Psychedelic Rock*). All musicians hold a bias towards the sound of their instrument as it appears to them *while they play*. Which is why when a guitarist hears their own wet take played side by side in context of the full mix, they many times choose the engineer‚Äôs.

# 6. Understand the Concept of the ‚ÄúMix Space‚Äù

1. ***Kick Drum*** ‚Äî center bottom
2. ***Snare*** ‚Äî lower center, left side
3. ***Cymbals*** ‚Äî Shimmering over top, spread wide
4. ***Pad*** ‚Äî fills in the stereo image
5. ***Lead melody*** ‚Äî loud and proud, center center
6. ***Rhythm guitar*** ‚Äî center, panned appropriately
7. ***Bass*** ‚Äî sandwiched between the Kick Drum Low and High

[Blues Band Mix Space ‚Äî Globe Institute of Recording &amp; Production](https://i.imgur.com/QoSfpm0.jpg)

# 7. Make a recording schedule

What days do we do this? What days do we do that? Making a schedule allows you to keep track of your timeline and your budget!

It also helps to keep the recording engineer prepared. Here‚Äôs an example:

1. Wednesday = Load In, Set up
2. Thursday = Drums, Bass, Rhythm Section
3. Friday = Vocals, Melody
4. Saturday = Solo Sections, Re-Amping
5. Sunday = Textures, ambience, transitions, finishing touches

# 8. Agree on who wrote the song.

This is important for two reasons ‚Äî 1. Publishing rights (who takes credit and royalties for the intellectual property of the songwriting) and 2. Who has final say on any creative and technical decisions in the studio, on that song. Knowing who wrote the song will help the Engineer appropriately direct questions and concerns in a 1 on 1 style, instead of towards the whole band (which can lead to time-consuming debate.) This is not a huge deal, but I personally like to be aware of the creative dynamic of whose input is more valuable than others. I‚Äôm really only adding this because part of being a recording engineer is working within the dynamic of a group of creative individuals, and you don‚Äôt want to accidentally disturb it. And I‚Äôve seen some arguments for sure‚Ä¶ moving on.

# 9. No family members or friends while tracking

Please leave your parents and siblings at home. I generally welcome significant others (*because spouses/partners of professional musicians ‚Äúget it‚Äù*) but if your companions in the studio are distracting an engineer while they are working (*or worse, distracting the musician while you are working*), the Engineer might ask them to leave‚Ä¶. its not vacation time for your Engineer. Its ***get-work-done-time***.

# 10 Leave the Drama (and the drugs) at the Door

As a general rule, keep your distractions away from the Engineer. Recording is a very stressful and methodical task. If you‚Äôve got a joint, take it outside. If you‚Äôve got beef with a band mate‚Ä¶

[Yeah, thats gonna be a no from me, dawg](https://i.imgur.com/7ZF9HxL.png)

# 11. Don‚Äôt steal our Gaff tape, that stuff is expensive.

\*guilty\*

# 12. Most performance-related flaws can be fixed in post

Miss a note on the solo? **Edit it in post.** Vocalist didn‚Äôt deliver that line quite right? **Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs 12 other takes**. Not enough Reverb? **I Give it the ole‚Äô Re-Amp treatment.** Kick drum is off beat? **Copy, Paste, baby!** Efficiency is the name of the game in the recording process.

*(also, click* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXfK9Osmvs) *if you don't understand the Troggs reference below.... GOLD)*

[The Troggs](https://i.imgur.com/wLu0tiv.jpg)

# 13. However, two things must be addressed immediately: Time and Pitch

This is an objective issue that can foil the recording process. If your engineer tells you that you are either: **Rushing/Dragging** or **Out of Tune**, be cognizant that this small flaw can jeopardize the track later in the Recording Process (when *you add elements like harmony, melody, and texture*).

Which leads nicely into the next tip:

# 14. Tune your instruments in between takes

Please bring a tuner to the session. In general, you should be ultra-aware of your tempo (*if you are a member of the rhythm section*) and your tuning/intonation (*if you are a member of the melody section*).

# 15. Do some exercise/stretches in between takes

This is really important ‚Äî Exercising in between takes can significantly increase everyone‚Äôs mood and energy going back into the studio. You can actually hear the difference in the takes. Not to mention it can help relieve all that stress and any pent up aggression you have towards your band mates. Not only is exercise good for not having a heart attack when you are 50, it‚Äôll actually make the recording process much smoother and make the takes themselves better (*in my opinion*).

[Relevant BoJack is Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/JEKZZed.png)

# 16. Show up prepared‚Ä¶ to wait

1. 75% of your time will be spent sitting and waiting, or listening to your band mates record, so bring something to keep you occupied but that won‚Äôt take you out of the zone. I recommend a video game that you love but that is also something that you can put down in an instant and that you aren‚Äôt really invested in. Something simple, like Mario Kart or Super Smash Brothers, or even a Pok√©mon game.
2. If you want to stay in a creative vibe, I recommend bringing something to draw or doodle with. Put on some headphones and go dance outside. (We have a Rubix cube that sees a lot of love)
3. The most important thing is not to bring something that will remove you from the mindset of the studio environment. I certainly do not recommend bringing your day job! I‚Äôve heard many times: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just bring my computer and knock out some emails for my Marketing job while I wait for everyone to finish tracking‚Äù. This is a bad idea ‚Äî it will remove you from the headspace that you, the creative artist, need to be in to make the most out of your time and your engineer‚Äôs time. Unless it is related to the Band (*ordering merchandise, responding to Promoters, confirming show details*, *etc*), I would leave it at home.

# 17. Beware of Burrito-itis

Pretty self-explanatory.

# 18. Hot tea makes a good coffee substitute for long recording sessions, but water is even better.

Staying Hydrated is super important, it‚Äôll keep you focused for the longer sessions, not to mention being hydrated is just awesome in general. Also, make sure your vocalist knows about **Throat Coat**, that stuff is the mamma-jammas

[Throat Coat](https://i.imgur.com/lhtmVV0.jpg)

# 19. The engineer is not your enemy

The Recording Engineer has one job: ***Be the bridge that transfers the highest quality version of your music into the physical world***. This manifests itself differently from producer to producer‚Ä¶ some engineers are technical producers and some engineers are people producers. It‚Äôs a balance of therapy and tough love, tech savvy &amp; emotional capacity, having the mental fortitude to keep going and the discipline to know when you‚Äôve gone far enough. The bottom line ‚Äî The Engineer is just doing what they believe is the best thing for the final product. So if your engineer delivers constructive criticism to you, such as ‚Äú*That take was a decent take, but I can hear the energy level dropping a bit. Let‚Äôs take 15 and regroup*‚Äù‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take it personally.

# 20. Bring your A-Game

Aside from the mental discipline needed for an efficient and productive studio session, I argue that every musician should take their instrument to the shop to get ‚Äútuned-up‚Äù before you begin your session.

1. **Guitarists**: a tune-up can address problems such as: Buzzing frets, Intonation problems, and Electrical noise, and will usually set you up with a set of fresh strings
2. **Vocalists**: Don‚Äôt go partying the night before and lose your voice plz &amp; thx ‚Äî signed, everyone.
3. **Drummers**: Put on new heads before the session and tune your drums every couple hours. Double check the chains on your kick and hi-hat pedals.
4. **Producers**: Check that all your cables, sound cards, interfaces, controllers and adapters are working before coming into the studio. We may not have what you need!
5. **Everyone else**: Don‚Äôt make fun of the drummer for tuning their kit, just be proud that they showed up at all (kidding :P)

# 21. The #1 goal should be capturing the energy of the performance

There is an indescribable rush of emotion and power that arises from well-performed and recorded music. It‚Äôs like tasting your mom‚Äôs signature dish, or watching a group of fighter jets dance in the skies. Where just for a moment, you forget about all the technical barriers and frustrations and troubleshooting‚Ä¶ you forget to monitor the faders on your console or the dB levels on your mic pre-amps‚Ä¶ and you sit back in awe at the musical masterpiece crafted in front of you. And you look down at your computer screen and watch with a smile as that energy is grasped from the ephemeral and poured like concrete into your hard drive. It‚Äôs the absolute best part about being an engineer ‚Äî Capturing the joy and energy and‚Ä¶ well, the magic.

# 22. Don‚Äôt suck, Have fun

I‚Äôm gonna get a tattoo of this one day.

1048,punk,punk,"Personally, I enjoy doing (non-aggressive) things that get me judged and shunned from ‚Äúthe man‚Äù. For example, having a mohawk will make some suburban mom at the grocery store hate me, and I love that. Wearing a circle jerks t-shirt will get me dirty looks when I go to the gym, so I do it often. Seeing people get so annoyed by something (or someone) who doesn‚Äôt adopt the arbitrary, trivial, nonsensical norms set forth by some uptight fascist brings a brilliant thrill. Just because I‚Äôm not wearing a white-collar, khaki shorts, boat shoes, and a ‚Äúnice‚Äù haircut means I‚Äôm somehow a threat. I‚Äôm a law-abiding citizen...but if someone wants to think I‚Äôm trouble simply because of my outfit, why not turn on some music too?

What do you enjoy doing to disrupt the rats in their race?"
921,punk,punk,"I‚Äôll start by saying that I myself am an African-American and I believe that these protests were bound to happen. My community is angry at all the injustices. The ones that happen on and off camera. I don‚Äôt hate all cops (even though that‚Äôs popular), I see people as individuals and I believe many cops, especially minority cops, goal is to serve and protect communities. At the same time the justice system in this system is horrible. It gives far more protection to cops then it does the people who need the most protection and cops always assume that minority groups, especially black and latino people, are up to no good. Something has to change but I don‚Äôt think that means being reckless.

Minority groups are more likely to die from Covid-19. These protests are going to continue to kill more black and brown people who live in the US. The groups are simply too large for their not to be people becoming infected in one way or another from this entire ordeal. Another things is it‚Äôs effect on the environment. People are reckless, throwing trash and signs and burning things up, and overall, it‚Äôs very bad for the environment. Lastly it‚Äôs effect on small businesses. Simply put, small businesses in the area, many of which are owned by minority groups, will be unable to recover from this financially. Even if they have insurance that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt consider the fact that it‚Äôs going to take time to clean up and rebuild and more money to replace burned or stolen items. This will cost far more money and take far more time then a small business could reasonably continue with no business at all considering all of this is being done just to be able to get business again. A target can rebuild. A mom and pop bar cannot. This is the sad reality of the situation and is going to end up taking money out of minority pockets as these business owners are forced to get another job and members of the community are forced to spend their money elsewhere."

A couple of things to keep in mind:

a) pop punk, like any genre, is subjective. I put some stuff on the playlist that I wouldn't necessarily consider pop punk, but is still in the same lane.

b) Most songs have at least SOMEBODY who hasn't heard it, so I know I can't please everyone. (eg. I had a friend who LOVES State Champs and Neck Deep, but didn't know Taking Back Sunday)

Hi Everyone,

We're writing to inform you that unfortunately Bayside's upcoming tour has been cancelled. You can find a statement from the band below.

This tour was meant to be a celebration of 20 years as a band and we wanted so badly to spend it with all of you but the world had other plans. We worked very hard at rebooking the entire tour for later in the summer but it became clear, even before announcing, that our postponed dates weren‚Äôt going to be possible either.*   
*We plan now to rebook the tour for some time next year. We‚Äôre making this decision because we just don‚Äôt know when it will be okay to tour again and if we ‚Äúcancel‚Äù then people can get refunds.*  
   
*This was on pace to be the most fun as well as the most successful tour we‚Äôve ever done so this really breaks our hearts as we‚Äôre sure it breaks yours. We promise you that we will make this happen at some point and we hope that when we can, you‚Äôll join us. Please stay safe and sane.*

What doesn't make sense is how the same five songs get reposted and become the most upvoted posts on the sub. Now it'd be cool if it was new songs and stuff but its the same 5 Fallout Boy and blink-182 songs. To me, as a pop punk fan i know these songs already, we all basically know these songs already. Why not post some new content? Why not post some cool bands trying to get some recognition. There's a ton of people in this subreddit trying to make some great pop punk music that people dont really bat an eye to. But if they were to repost ""Whats my Age Again"" everyone gets excited like its something thats never been heard before.

That being said, Ive been trying to listen to a lot of these self posts and made a playlist (link below). Theres some really impressive stuff on there all from users who use this subreddit and were willing to share their hard work and efforts (for example I recommend checking out Good Bloom, they deserve your attention)

I thought I would give everyone the chance to listen to a fuckin awesome local band in the Seattle area, Neutralboy! . They've been around for 28 years and still makin great punk rock music. They try to tour through out the states as much as they can when all 3 band mates schedules are flexible enough, so you may already know who they are if you're into the local underground punk rock scene.
(Especially if you're in Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota and Utah areas).
So, click the links, sit back, relax and enjoy listening to a great underground local Seattle area band.

Lead singer Mike's solo 'Evil Fucker' music is also online now.

Neutralboy!'s next show is Tuesday the 17th of March at O'Malley's Irish pud 2403 6th ave in Tacoma, Wa.
Their shows are a blast and so are the dudes in the band.

They will also be going on a small tour this April in Colorado.
Details of this tour is on their Facebook page.

1183,punk,punk,"I‚Äôve seen a few posts about emo and whether or not it‚Äôs punk. I thought I‚Äôd try to clear that up because I know a lot of people on this sub are not huge fans of emo at all or only extend to the DC Dischord Records releases in the genre.

The basic answer is, when it began yes but now it‚Äôs not necessarily.

Emo originated in the mid-80s DC Hardcore scene where it began as a more emotional expressive and melodic form of hardcore with bands like Rites of Spring, Embrace, and Dag Nasty. These bands took direct influence from Minor Threat and Bad Brains. Later members of Rites of Spring and Embrace formed Fugazi who are decidedly not emo. In Maryland there were bands like Moss Icon and The Hated that formed and the genre started to spread more across the country with bands like Jawbreaker in NY removing the hardcore elements and instead focusing on a more heartfelt punk approach to the genre.

By the mid-90s emo had spread across the US and into Japan where a few different genres formed. In San Diego and San Francisco screamo was pioneered by Portraits of Past, Heroin, Swing Kids and Antioch Arrow. The latter two bands helped create modern emo fashion with Swing Kids adopting the swoopy dyed black hair style and Antioch Arrow introdung dark makeup influenced by gothic rock. Non Screamo bands like Drive Like Jehu brought math rock influence to emo. All of these bands were closely tied to the hardcore scene and played alongside non emo bands. Screamo spread to Japan with groups like Envy. In the late 90s and early 2000s Screamo bands started taking influence from extreme styles of hardcore like grindcore and emoviolence to create the more aggressive style called emoviolence. Some of these bands include Pg.99, Orchid, Jeromes Dream, Usurp Synapse, and Circle Takes The Square. 

In North West, Midwest, and South West US a indie rock style of emo was created known as Midwest emo. This is where the departure from punk and hardcore musically comes from. The bands in this scene came from an array of backgrounds. Sunny Day Real Estate was a band from the Seattle grunge scene that took the loud choruses, distortion, and lazy vocals of grunge and fused it with the melodic nature of emo. The band people usually say is responsible for beginning this style is Cap‚Äôn Jazz who had a much more melodic, twinkly, and fun sound then the DC bands that was influenced by math and indie rock. The band still kept punk energy and occasionally used screamed vocals. Some other important bands in this scene include Mineral, Braid, Boys Life, American Football, Christie Front Drive, and Pedro The Lion, all of which are only punk bands in spirit.

Some Midwest emo bands started to fuse the genre with the mainstream pop punk and power pop of that era creating emo pop. Some of these bands include Jimmy Eat World, Get Up Kids, and The Promise Ring. Some mainstream bands like Weezer started to adopt a more emotional power pop approach as well with Weezer releasing the album Pinkerton, often credited with being an important album for emo pop and on for the first instances of an emo or emo-adjacent band reaching a mainstream audience.

Emo pop would spread to NJ and NY in the mid-90s and to early 2000s through a number of melodic hardcore and pop punk groups adopting the style in the area such as Lifetime, Saves The Day, Armor For Sleep, Midtown, Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, and My Chemical Romance (who would abandon many of their real emo influences following their debut album).

Many of the Midwest emo and emo pop bands grew up on punk and within the punk scene, some of which who were actually in hardcore bands such as James Dewees who began in the metalcore band Coalesce, before transitioning to the Get Up Kids. Or the members of Fall Out Boy who before releasing their debut album (which is regarding typically as emo pop though they later abandoned the genre) were members of the Chicago hardcore scene, with Pete Wentz especially being the vocalist of the metalcore band Arma Angelus and the bassist of grindcore band Racetraitor.

Long story short due to the constantly evolving nature of the genre many bands have strayed away from punk rock moving onto influences from other punk influences genres like pop punk and indie or even unrelated genres like indie folk and acoustic (in the case of Bright Eyes and Dashboard Confessional)."

The film uses music in the style of Neck Deep, Blink-182 and Paramore, as well as heavier groups such as Bring Me The Horizon, A Day To Remember, and I Prevail. We are working with musicians from around the world to help create the music for the film, and this is a major collaborative effort.

&amp;#x200B;

 For those who didn't see, the plot is as follows:

&gt;The film follows the story of Raven, a failed Broadway actress turned amateur adult film star who attempts to leave the industry and move back home. However, her family believe she made it big in America, forcing her to live a lie.  
&gt;  
&gt;Raven uses music to escape her dark reality as she tries to start her life anew, getting a new job and entering into a new same sex relationship; however the adult film industry has taken its toll, leaving her paranoid and mentally, physically and emotionally vulnerable.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the first cheap bass I could find on Craigslist‚Äîthis one for $60. The thing was in rough shape, with dirt caked into the fretboard, loose pots/a loose jack, and strings that probably hadn‚Äôt been changed in years.

I took the bass apart and tightened up the jack and pots, wiped the whole thing clean, bought new strings and leaned how to set up the bass myself. No custom parts yet, but now I‚Äôm in the process of adding stickers to it. Hoping some local shows I want to hit up this summer plus an Anti-Flag show I‚Äôm going to next month will provide some good ones.

3455,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Across the Pop Punk/Post-Hardcore/Metalcore spectrum, it's obviously a stereotype for bands to adapt styles by toning down their original heaviness, with varying critical/financial/fan reception. Trophy Eyes, Bring Me The Horizon, Boston Manor, Neck Deep, Fallout Boy as some new and old examples of this stereotype.

As someone that enjoys the punk and post-hardcore crossovers and flavours of pop punk, I'd rather it wasn't the case, but bands developing their sound isn't unexpected.

Does anyone know of bands in this spectrum taking the opposite approach and adding heavier influences or even committing fully to a heavier genre, and was it an effective switch musically (in your opinion), critically or financially?"

Would you guys recommend me some new punks like PUP or that you think might be closer to the ones i mentioned?

2928,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hello! I have decided to create a little bingo game to be used by our community here. I hope to use it to have people notice some under appreciated songs in their playlist, or start discussions with people who maybe haven't heard these songs. So, with that said, let's go on to how to play and the rules.
How to play

* Click this link https://bingobaker.com/play/2996933 and generate a board

* Go to your preferred music service, and click shuffle on your favorite playlist

* When a song comes up that matches a space on the bingo board, click on it to mark it off

* When you get a bingo, post your results here, along with the songs you used. If you're feeling up to the challenge (Of writing down every song) you can try to complete the whole board. However, just one line is necessary.

Rules

* Don't add any songs to the queue. The songs used can only be given to you by the RNG gods

* A single song cannot be used for multiple spaces. A single, one-line bingo must use 5 different songs

* Please be legit. Don't just make up results

* Obviously, I can't enforce the rules or prove your validity, but let's all just be honest here and have fun. This isn't a competition

I hope this is something people will actually enjoy, as I think it would be fun to keep track of the songs you listen to, and have discussions with others. I hope we can all have a fun time enjoying music together, especially in times like this. Feel free to send the link to others and play with them. Have fun guys! (Also, I'm not sure if this is pin worthy, but I think it'd be fun if we can get as many people as possible to play) 

Oh, and feel free to suggest spaces you think would be a nice addition. I can edit the board whenever, and it shouldn't be a problem."
1713,punk,punk,"I listen to an unknown up-tempo punk band in 1992. What I remember is just a little: a song that said something about deja-vu and its continuosly going faster until you heard the needle of a turntable scratching noisely over a vynil; and a song that said something like  -I went to a party / and I jumped in a fight - or something similar. Back in those days, I barely understood the english language. This are the only parts that I remember.
At high school, a friend pass me a cassette with many differents bands: 4 Walls Falling (Culture Shock), Visual Discrimination (In Vain), CTC (Colombia), this unknown to me band, and a few songs of Let's Go Bowling (Music to Bowl by).
I want to know if this band will pass the test of time with me. Any help will be really appreciated"
1591,punk,punk,"I've always loved the punk community because I feel so welcome here but recently I've been getting a lot of hate for listening to other music besides punk and I find that extremely stupid. I've been called a poser for liking bands like blink-182 and Sum 41, I've been called a fake for liking metal of all kinds (besides black metal), and if I even dare share an opinion different from someone else's I might as well be worthless. I think the punk community needs to be more open minded but also stay the same if you get that. Sorry for the rant I just needed to share."

I honestly don‚Äôt even know if he‚Äôs severely mentally ill right now, or just super delusional and fucked up. He‚Äôs also saying he‚Äôs a devoted Christian and is against gay marriage.   Literally all of his songs are about murder, and I highly doubt he follows any of the other Christian rules either.

Now with a lot of spare time due to Social Isolation I would like to further broaden my perspective. I you would like to tell me about your local Scene and/ or would like to learn about (the History of) Punk in Nothern Germany, just leave me a message!

It was always sentimental to me but as I've been getting progressively more into punk music I've listened to some of their other stuff and I absolutely love their stuff. I really like his raspy voice and I like how they don't use that one staple punk tune I hear a lot. I like her backup singing and the guitar and bass are always fantastic.

\*I think\* the song mentioned being 23.Pretty sure the song talks about how much it sucks ass growing up I remember something about washing dishes in the song? But I might be wrong about that.It mentioned working in the song, unsure if this is related to the washing dishes part.

I used to think the song was by a band called ""Sydney""  Probably Best known for the song ""Got some Purple Stuff"" This band sounds incredibly similar. I looked through the bands discography and couldn't find the song though.

[Bracket Link](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y2wFnHv)

Some notes:

1. I did my best to stick to one album per artist; however, I made one exception. 


2. In order to prevent my own bias in determining the seedlings, I tried my best to come up with seeds based on Spotify streams, ‚Äúbest of‚Äù/‚Äúyear-end‚Äù type lists, and what fans of the bands tend to consider their favorites. There was no formula for the seedlings other than this, so it was a little bit judgment-based.


3. The brackets are set up by years that so that I could most accurately make some challenging brackets by making each one as hard as possible, since it‚Äôs all in good fun. The years are a little bit more biased based on my personal listening habits but I did my best to make the brackets representative of the genre as a whole. 


4. It was tough deciding which albums by some bands to pick.

2002,punk,poppunkers,"Here is [the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJn-Jl2ZeQU&amp;list=RDBJn-Jl2ZeQU&amp;start_radio=1) I'm referring to, if you haven't heard it. It was nominated for an academy award (should've won). I always loved this movie growing up and just watched it over the weekend. I was surprised when I looked up who actually sang the song. RIP Adam."
1387,punk,punk,"Raymond Pettibon, known best as a artist for bands like Black Flag, Sonic Youth, The Minutemen, and Foo Fighters also works in other mediums. I saw an indie movie he made called 'Sir Drone' starring Mike Watt of The Minutemen at a film festival in Brooklyn about 7 years ago. 

Turns out he makes music too, an album called ""S√ºr Drone"" (98), Torches And Standards (90) w/ with a band Super Session, The Nichemakers (09), and a project called Sock-Tite again with Mike Watt (13/18). 

Alot of it sounds spoken word that he does with backing bands

Does anyone have any of these records or seen their shows?"
412,punk,punk,"The shithead was only in the band from 95-98.  Can't tell you a single song from that era.  I keep seeing people saying he's ruining Misfits' legacy, but you have to be a fucking mouth breather to even know his songs in the first place.  Nobody even remembered him until all this shit came out.  Just go back to the way things were and completely forget about him. Keep listening to Walk Among Us and quit giving that trash any amount of spotlight."

3570,poppunkers,poppunkers,"What do you expect / want Hayley Williams solo music to sound like? 

Think it will sound like every mainstream artist that you hear on the radio? Sound similar to the latest Paramore album? Or something completely different even?"
1687,punk,punk,i‚Äôm not punk but i sometimes like to listen to punk-ish music but with everything that‚Äôs going on in the world right now i really need an outlet! does anyone have suggestions of good songs/bands to get into punk music with? some good songs to scream to lol. especially if their girl bands! thanks :)
2740,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Is it no longer a courtesy to mention the original artist in a cover title?

""Hammer"" by Point North was one of my favorites and then I found out it was a cover.  
""Better"" from the same band is also amazing. I then found out that is ALSO a cover.

""XO Tour Llif3"" from Driveways is really good. Wasn't until I looked up the lyrics I found it that it ALSO a cover.

I really don't listen to rap so that's why I wouldn't know they are covers."
1058,punk,punk,Cause apparently being a crybaby nerd is much more punk

Any takers?!"
2054,poppunkers,poppunkers,I‚Äôm trying to make a playlist of songs about how girls suck lmao. Basically songs like Dysentery Gary and Dammit by Blink-182. I just need some suggestions to add to the list I already have. Help would be appreciated (:
991,punk,punk,Plz help im new to this shit and I really don't feel like making my own if I don't have to.
3109,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Obviously a ton of tours have been canceled over the last 72 hours with more probably getting the axe in the coming days. 

I know that bands invest a lot into putting these tours together, and many are likely in a tough spot financially after having them go down the drain. I‚Äôm looking to buy some music or merch from bands that are struggling because of this, and I thought it might be cool if we could get a thread going to support the bands that have had to cancel shows and help them make up the lost income.

Even if you don‚Äôt have the cash on hand for vinyl or a hoodie or whatever, even tossing $5 or $10 get an album on bandcamp could help keep some of the bands that we love afloat."
1185,punk,punk,"How do you make a deal involving money and work hours without any legal shenanigans and not immediately bury yourself in endless feuds and misunderstandings? 

Dischord is a relatively well working label. I feel like it could be a great exemple of a working anarchy."

2265,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Fairly new to the newer bands in this genre, I use to listen to a lot of stuff like blink, MCR, sum41 ect but found bands like neck deep and state champs and would love to know more!"
2442,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I don't get it. Their music used to be cool. But now it feels like something I can find on a pop radio station every day. It's not weird. It's not different. It's just what the majority of people will like. Well I didn't come to their music to hear what the majority will like. I wanted to hear something different and cool. But it's almost as they're selling out to the majority of people. We went from ""We don't believe what's on TV"" to ""Level of Concern"" and I'm like WTF.

But the person who really did it bad was Brendon Urie. Like WTF. Thank gosh we have Palaye Royale. Their music makes an impact on the genre for the better. But I can't tell the difference between high hopes and anything else that's on the radio."

2. How do I get it to look anything like the actual logo? Should I use a stencil of some sorts?
3. What are some ways to really make it look SICK?"

‚ÄúAmerican Idiot‚Äù is underrated. I (for one) wrote it off because it was mainstream, and I regret it.

1004,punk,punk,"After crying to Never Meant and some midwestern emo mixtapes you found on YouTube and shotgunning 19 cans of nonalcoholic vegan soy root beer for a couple of hours you check your local hardcore group page and see a post for another concert next week. It‚Äôs Solace, XRespectxYouthx, a local pop punk band called My Sunday Confessfinal (they are really out of place) and a local metalcore band called Burning Cupid. The show starts at 8 and doors at 7 so you have time to go right after work and the show ends at 11 so you can probaly have dinner after. You are friends with all the bands on Facebook even though you never really spoke to them. You check your bank account and realized you only have 30 dollars in your account but hey who needs food right. You click the I'm going option. The day comes you put on your black Harms way hoodie and X your hands, black/white vans, put your camo shorts and xibadla cap. You get on the bus. You get to the show people are outside smoking and chating. You see ton of people hugging and laughing but once the show starts they will start beating each other up and spinkicking and throwing each other off stages. Everyone either looks like someone from the 90s or the girl from recess. The venue is in a rough neighborhood so you quickly run inside. The place was a garage that was turned into a skateboard park. You pay for your ticket and awkwardly stand there looking at your phone. The show starts. The first band Solace A local melodic hardcore band comes on. The band is just a Counterparts rip off band. people push piting, 2 steping, stage diving and spin kicking. A few people were mic grabbing to the song Decay. The first band ends. People are going outside and room clear ups. You go get some merch. A shirt with old English font in black, a black hoodie with scribles and bubble font and have a chat with the band members. You spend your last dollars on merch. Who needs food right? . People are coming back inside the band xRespectxYouthx a Straight edge Metallic Hardcore band comes on. All their songs about Straight Edge and being positive. You go the front of the stage and you look around. Oh shit. Is it really her? you see that girl again from the last hardcore show. She cut her hair. It now is bangs with her hair to her shoulder (Idk what you call it but you guys can probably imagine it) The band is about to start. Dammit you need to get her attention but how? You look at her the lights coming down like a light from heaven like a spotlight shinning down on her. An angel with raven black dyed hair and a knocked loose hoodie that's way to big for her but she looks cute in it and a black beanie. You look at her the lights from the stage shines into her beautiful hazel eyes and snowwhite skin. The room opens up and it's just her moshing. Your heart starts to race. Her beautiful black hair sways from side to side. As she moshes. The way she moshes is like a ballerina fighting off ninjas. Gracefully moshing. You are in awe. Time stands still when you looked at her you are infatuated with her. Her face imprinted on angels. The way she mosh brought you into a trance. She spinkicked into your heart. Your heart beats faster than a powerviolence band like blasts beats thuming in your heart. It felt like in those romance movies where the guy first meets the girl and everything in the room disappears and it's just her. You start to feel all happy inside. You fell in love with the girl at the rock show. Is this love, you tell yourself? The band does a 10 minute speech on racism, being straight edge, hating cops and trump, says mother fucker every two words and tells everyone about respect than tells the crowd go kill and murder each other. Every song ends with him remiding everyone the band is Straight Edge. The singer with a black Bane hoodie wearing a hoodie over a Have Heart baseball cap screams into the mic. He walks back and forth with one hand high to his face his arms form a L shape. I WANT EVERY MOTHER DUCKER TO OPEN THIS PIT AND KILL EVERYONE I WANT TO SEE BLOOD AND GUTS 2020 NORTHWEST HARDCORE MOTHER DUCKER (CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG). Peope start piling up and grabing the micphone like people trying to get the last tv in black Friday. The room smells like weed, beer, sweat, e vape and piss. The smells suffokates you and you can‚Äôt seem to breathe. the screamer and everyone yells "" STRAIGHT EDGE FOR LIFE"" he jumps and makes a werid blegh, oof, ugh like a sick constipated guy and the whole room goes ape shit. You push everyone way and start spin kicking, crowdkilling and stage diving kind of like a peacock trying to attract a mate. People fall and blood starts to spill. A couple of teeths go flying into the sky. People started pushing each other and look like they are trying to fight invisible ninjas. You push yourself into the crowd and you throw a tiny 14 year old wearing a title fight hoodie and harry potter glasses and emo hair into the crowd. A shirtless overweight bald guy who with tattoos throws punches and jumps a little bit before pushes himself into a guy. His fat giggles. He pushes himself into a skinny guy with long hair wearing a backward cap, skinny black jeans and a vein windbreaker. The only non-causian guy in the local hardcore band shirt stading¬† in the background drinking a beer. The dude in the metal shirt head banging behind the mosh pit and occcianlly pushes the moshers. A guy who looks like the singer for Hams Way. He is probably super drunk. He screams FUCK YEAH and crushes his beer can with his head and spin kicks and knocks out a 14 year old girl in a pop punk shirt. Her mom than screams at the guy and the guy cries. Huh turns out that's his mom. A guy with plugs, black beanie and nails shirt stands on the side with cross arms and looks piss he's the drummer for solace. A girl who looks like Thron from hex girls shakes her water bottle and rocks back and forth. Shes the ex of the singer for xRespectxYouthx. a dude with a beard and blad hair, wearing a death metal shirt and  crust punk battlejacket with a discharge, infest, crass, bad brains and minor threat that costs 1000 dollars patches pounds his chest like a gorilla and throws a tiny little Asian kid with a Man overboard hoodie and blink 182 cap¬† into a merch table and than hits his head with a beer bottle. The dude flexes his muslces not his fucking head. A guy wearing a jesery with long hair, glasses, a beard and overweighted punches the overweight blad guy who looks way to old to go to shows. A girl with silver hair with long bangs and a girl with short orange double ponytail hair and girl with red hair long hair with bangs. They look like the goth girl from Filmore and teen drama island. They randomly hits a guy wearing a fannel shirt over a hoodie with a moustache and a beanie and a little bit of hair coming out of both side (idk how to explain it) and khaki pants. You go and start hitting and punching the adrenaline starts getting to you. You hope she noticed you. Than all of a sudden the world goes black. You wake up and you are on the ground. You get back up and the girl looks at you and screams like Jacob Bannon. A guy wearing an Expire hoodie and a tough shirtless guy faints, the band stops and ask if you are okay. You look at your arm the bones are sticking from your skin and blood is pouring down onto the cement ground that's already sticky from spilled beer. You smile at the girl but she pukes and runs away. While you were leaving in an ambulance you see the girl and another guy. A tall ginger hair guy probably 6 feet with facial hair, probably a whole lot older than her (my guess late 20s), tattoos on his legs, buff, plugs in his ears, wearing a black hoodie with old English font and camo shorts even though it's winter. You go back home and cry to The Story Overboard, Joysmithhaus and some acoustic pop-punk and drowning your sorrows in vegan non alcoholic root beer. You go through photos of that goth girl on her tumblr. Her tumblr page filled with pictures of her tattoos, Wiccan stuff, and her black cat named after a witch. The girl is pretty much Thorn from hex girl. You wipe away the tears and get out your Akai MPK beat maschine. You get out your microphone and starting singing with an autotune fake british accent like all those early 2000s emo bands over a sample of my Heroin with 808s. Songs about a goth girl and rejection You realized the only way to win her heart is to become a emo rapper. You change your name from xBroxChadx to Lil Depresssadboi. It only takes one rejection from a girl to make even the most toughest guy into a sad emo rapper.¬†"

‚ÄúTrue ""punk"" had nothing to do with fashion. In my eyes, the real punks back then were totally nondescript looking dudes like the Circle Jerks are in this video, and various other LA and DC hardcore bands from that era. Sporting the punk uniform was conformity in my eyes. Mohawks, expensive leather jackets and Doc Martens, expensive tattoos, piercings and Doc Martens, concert T-Shirts and tons of pins and patches. All that shit cost lots of money. Most ""real"" punks I knew were broke kids who couldn't afford tha shit, and wouldn't have been able to look like that even if they could because they were working shit jobs. Punk is and always will be a state of mind, not a fashion statement.‚Äù

3417,poppunkers,poppunkers,"When I was in high school and college I feared getting old and boring.

When I finished college and moved to the city I live in now I was excited at going to many many shows since they happened here so often, but then I remember calculating that since I was 24 I only had about 6 more years of going to shows regularly left! And that's the same amount of time I had been an adult and going to shows regularly at all and kind of panicked. And then I feared only going to about 2-3 a year when some huge band I had been into since did a big tour. Well that didn't happen. I also was worried about going to shows but always being the oldest person there and feeling creepy...also not happening!

It was pretty funny and unexpected because I think of myself going to those early high school and college aged shows and being impressed at the ""really old"" people about 27 who were there. Things changed. Maybe it's a Millennial thing, but I would've expected my older self way back in the day to think I'd be too embarrassed to go see bands like Neck Deep and The Wonder Years (explaining who they were of course and the years they blew up to my younger self lol)...yet I did and I didn't even stand out as the creepy old guy because the age range present was huge and I was well within it. Or that I'd still be going to the type of shows where a bunch of local bands play to a bunch of heavily drinking crowd in some dive bar except now these are often people after the show going home to their spouses and kids (or a babysitter with their kids because they went together) instead of drunk college students going home fearing class hungover the next day. Because I would've never expected it at those college shows.

Anyway it's really awesome and I'm glad I grew up during the age when it would be possible."

I thought I would give everyone the chance to listen to a fuckin awesome local band in the Seattle area, Neutralboy! . They've been around for 28 years and still makin great punk rock music. They try to tour through out the states as much as they can when all 3 band mates schedules are flexible enough, so you may already know who they are if you're into the local underground punk rock scene.
(Especially if you're in Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota and Utah areas).
So, click the links, sit back, relax and enjoy listening to a great underground local Seattle area band.

Lead singer Mike's solo 'Evil Fucker' music is also online now.

Neutralboy!'s next show is Tuesday the 17th of March at O'Malley's Irish pud 2403 6th ave in Tacoma, Wa.
Their shows are a blast and so are the dudes in the band.

They will also be going on a small tour this April in Colorado.

2958,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Total newbie here. I found this sub 2 minutes ago and actually come from a classical music background. But I accidentally found Mmhmm by Relient K and Letters To The President by Hawk Nelson and it changed my life. Newer Hawk Nelson is so different and disappointing. Though I did love Air for Free by Relient K it‚Äôs clearly a different vibe.

So I‚Äôm looking for some other stuff now. Please don‚Äôt hate me for this but I just don‚Äôt like tracks with screaming on it, but my faves are California by Hawk Nelson and High of 75 by Relient K. I‚Äôm a chronic optimist and definitely not at all someone you‚Äôd ever expect to be into pop punk, I like upbeat feel-good vibes, I don‚Äôt like tracks that linger in depression. Is there anything else like that, that you‚Äôd recommend for someone like me? 

I listen to some ambient stuff like Port Blue, and Windsor Airlift if that helps. So I do like Owl City, usually upbeat vibes which suits my style, and he‚Äôs one of the few artists I‚Äôve ever heard that uses orchestral instruments in an original way that doesn‚Äôt sound too fake if that makes sense. I guess that‚Äôs the classical in me talking again, but whenever he uses strings tracks it sounds authentic to the instrument, different but still good, not like you found your nearest cellist, put a gun to their head so they‚Äôd play, and then auto tuned them, which is what most strings in pop music sound like to me."

If you claim punk yet are a music elitist... Thats not very punk rock of you and you need to learn you some true punk mentality. Other genres of music aren't your enemy. Any true punk wouldn't stand for elitism of any kind"

539,punk,punk,"I think that Right wing punks get too much flak for "" not being punk rock"" when in reality punk was always about going against social norms and shocking Communities with your political beliefs. I think its punk rock to piss off gatekeepers who label you and tell you what you are because you don't follow a specific guideline or mold to fit in because you believe in something else . Because being punk rock isn't about following the ""crowd"" , its about standing out and making your own path and being bold in every moment of your life. Well that's what I think anyway"

I havent even gone to a protest since I was kid, but I use punk and heavy metal music to vent my frustrations about life and my economic situation. I dont even hang out with other punks these days because the scene is just full of insane dangerous people. Im a peaceful punk. Im angry but Im older now. Too old to be moshing and getting my head smashed in by strangers.

I guess what Im saying is that Im definitely a heavy metal punk, definitely a loner, and absolutely am peaceful. Its probably silly to worry about this kind of thing at my age, but what am I supposed to do? Emotions dont stop after you turn 18. Everyone acts like an angry child forever but I guess I just embrace it.

After the success of [my latest video on Hanatarash](https://youtu.be/2YPkRW6ggs8), I am going to begin working on my latest video about the infamous and mysterious Les Rallizes D√©nud√©s.

During my initial research, much of this band is deemed unknown but the rumors, legends and what is known about them is unbelievably fascinating.

I wanted to ask if anyone would be able to provide me with some informative articles, web pages, or anything else they think would be crucial to include in a video about their story, legacy and lore. I've gone through the first couple of articles that pop up, but if there is anything out there that you've seen before that you believe is vital towards the story please let me know!

I've gathered up a couple sources so far (thanks to [u/synthmalicious](https://www.reddit.com/u/synthmalicious/)) for providing me with a [red bull article about the band](https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2014/12/les-rallizes-denudes-feature) as well [this article](https://dangerousminds.net/comments/japans_most_mysterious_band_les_rallizes_denudes) , but I always like to have as many resources as possible to go off of!

Ultimately, these Japanese rock bands from the 70's and 80's that sprouted during the birth of punk can be very obscure information wise, so any help at all is hugely appreciated! I want to make sure I do not leave anything out and give the story *(or atleast what is known of it)* of this band justice in video as good as it can possibly be.

Cheers and thank you!"

We're a Canadian band from Oakville, Ontario and this will be our 3rd EP. We've done a lot of touring in Canada and were planning on getting into the USA later this year but that seems unlikely now.

I've seen a lot of people looking for new music lately and with the pandemic going on most bands have delayed their releases. Let me know what you all think! I'll try to respond to any and all questions.

3373,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Do you have any opinions that over the years have completely changed? Here‚Äôs some of mine as examples:

For the most part I couldn‚Äôt stand Neighborhoods (the Blink album) and I thought it was pretty terrible and I had tried it a good few times until about 4 months ago I decided to stick it on just to see if my mind had changed and now I really like it apart from Wishing Well that I still think is awful. California is an album that I liked instantly i always stuck for it for when people would say how bad it was but recently I listened to it in full again and don‚Äôt get me wrong I still like it but it‚Äôs gone way down in terms of where I‚Äôd rank it among my favourite albums by them  

I kept hearing about Transit as a lot of bands I love and follow on social media was talking about them when they split up and I‚Äôd had never heard of them before and I thought as loads of bands was tweeting about them I‚Äôd give them a go. I like to try things a few times at different points when I can‚Äôt instantly get into it  and I tried Transit a fair few times and I just didn‚Äôt get them and they did nothing for me and then about 6 months later a song randomly came on Spotify (some random playlist) and I was hooked ever since then and now I love them

About 2-3 years ago I was massively into Knuckle Puck, I couldn‚Äôt get enough of them and I thought they was destined to blow up and be the next big thing in the scene and for whatever reason I stopped listening to them and about a year ago I put them on for the first time in at least 5 months (maybe more) and my mind just changed instantly. I can‚Äôt tell you for the life of me what it was but I just thought to myself ‚Äúwhy did I ever like this band‚Äù and now I think they are awful and I can‚Äôt listen to them"

However I do wish people could stop making other punk metal heads look bad by falsely accusing others of being a fascist or a Nazi, and maybe it would help by also learning more about the history of true fascism instead of the obvious, it‚Äôs suppresses voices, goes against equality, ect.

I‚Äôll openly say now that I do find some of our current presidents political takes to be very helpful to the country and in the same ways I don‚Äôt fully agree with him, I would never vote for him however I find we were given a shitty hand of politicians who all have their pros and cons.

But back on topic, I‚Äôve been called a fascist and racist for weeks because I simply said I find trumps political takes to be good, in my personal experience, saying that alone will spread like wild fire amongst people, regardless if I said I would never vote for him, people have continuously harassed me. It‚Äôs gotten so bad I was fired from my current place of work for being ‚Äúracist‚Äù and me supporting hate groups even though I completely stand for and sometimes if I have time, join with community‚Äôs who fight against racism, fascism, ect; I have had to move from a country to another just to make sure I could still get a job and make ends meet, and luckily I have.

As for my traveling I have found comfort back in the community through people who do find it to be rather stupid and upsetting that people are constantly harassed due to false accusations of being a fascist amongst other things."

I'm rlly into riot grrrl especially bikini kill cuz I feel like they just found a way to put exactly my experiences and my feelings into music and I love that sm! I was looking for some music recs since I've lost all the ones ppl shared in my old account. I'll list some of my favourite bands below so u can get a feel of my niche

Dead Kennedys
Bikini kill
Dead moon
Nirvana(i know some ppl qualify it as punkish and some don't but I thought I'd include)
Hole/Courtney love's solo music
Bad brains
Black flag
Minor threat
L7
The exploited

Idk if anyone has any reccomendations based in those but I'd love to hear them! Last

The show lasted about 55 minutes, but it was worth going to for All Get Out alone. I'm not sure why the band keeps saying that they're playing the whole album when they clearly are not. Cheers."

Last year my entire top 5 for AOTY consisted of pop albums. So far this year 10 (or 9) of my top 12 is some form of rock music. Releases such as Boston Manor, Spanish Love Songs, and Polaris are masterpieces meanwhile there have been a ton of really good rock albums to pad the deck. Lots of amazing scene albums and even albums in other rock genres just continue to amaze me this year. 

For example 10 of my top 12 albums of 2020 at the moment consists of Spanish Love Songs, Boston Manor, Polaris, Tame Impala, Brian Fallon, 5SOS, Handguns, Hot Mulligan, Four Year Strong, and Slotface. 

On top of my personal list there have been other great releases such as The Amity Affliction, Dance Gavin Dance, Trivium, Silverstein, Code Orange, All Time Low, Dead Lakes and more. Plus we have a lot to look forward to with Broadside, Don Broco, Everytime I Die, McCafferty,, Metro Station, Neck Deep, State Champs, Simple Plan, Less Than Jake, Angels and Airwaves, A Day to Remember, Emery, The 1975, Pierce the Veil, Super Whatever, The Ghost Inside and more.

I‚Äôm struggling to recall a recent year with this much good rock music. The year that keeps popping into my mind is 2014 for some reason but I can‚Äôt even recall exactly which albums were exactly 2014.

To make it more interesting I'm only going to include bands that became popular after 2010. For example although Blink has still been a very prominent band after 2010 they won't be included because the became huge much earlier. On the other side although The Wonder Years released music before 2010 they weren't really popular until 2010 so they will be included.

1248,punk,punk,"So I've been reading Our Band Could Be Your Life and loving it. I'm blown away by Azerrad's incredible knowledge of his subject, the way he weaves each chapter together to form a narrative, the little details that do so much to humanise the musicians. I mostly love his selection of bands to include.

But it seems like he skipped a few bands that perfectly fit the bill - influential, hardcore or hardcore-adjacent, independently distributed - and it isn't clear why. I'm specifically wondering why Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains and Meat Puppets don't get profiles, given the amount they turn up in other people's stories.

Obviously Azerrad's profiling the groups he feels most passionate about, which is exactly what he should be doing, and I'm not necessarily knocking his choices - I'm just curious why groups like the DKs didn't make the cut. Was the book getting too big? Could he not get interviews? I'd love to know if he's explained his selection anywhere.

Thanks!"

2671,poppunkers,poppunkers,"For those who don't remember the band Sullivan, they were an emo and pop-punk influenced pop rock band on Tooth &amp; Nail in the mid-aughts. If you haven't heard their first two albums, I can't recommend them enough; they've held up and grown with me in ways that a lot of albums from that period haven't. Their third is less important. It was a decent reunion album.

However, I'm not here just to talk about Sullivan. I'm here to talk about the lead vocalist's current project, Surprises. They released a pop-punk (like windows down, summery pop-punk) album last year called Natural Disaster, and it's one of the best pop-punk albums I've heard in a very long time. I remembered he was supposed to be working on something and found this album a few days ago. I haven't been able to stop listening. The feeling of finding new music by an artist who meant that much to you is truly incredible, and I just wanted to share the joy!

Recommended songs for dipping your toes into Sullivan: Down Here, We All Float and F-Stop.

Recommended songs for dipping your toes into Surprises: Just start the album from the beginning and see what you think."

1139,punk,punk,"If at all. Would be cool to hear which bands or people in the scene influenced you politically. Even if punk music made you disillusioned with politics it still counts. I got into punk via my uncle when I was 10. For me, punk music challenged me to question everything and think for myself and opened my eyes to all the propaganda we are exposed to every day and everywhere, from school, to the media, to the government. I suppose politically I would be somewhere in the middle. I agree with views and ideas from both the left and right but there are alot of things I don't like about either and both sides lie and use propaganda. Yet there is no political party I agree with. The bands that influenced my views were Dead Kennedys, Crass, Conflict, Discharge, External Menace and Stiff Little Fingers. I discovered other bands later but these where the bands that changed my life."

1148,punk,punk,"I first got into punk years back. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before and I thought it was great there was other kids just as interested in it as i was and it was a particular exciting time in my life. However three years later down the line I have got a bit older and I phased out of punk for a while It just became another thing for me and I was no longer angry at society but I became a part of it. I've tried getting back into it recently by listening to the music and stuff but it's not like it used to be. How do I get the mindset of punk back into me?

Btw I don't want to hear any crap about how the mindset should always be with me otherwise I'm not a real punk or any of that bull. I would just like a straight answer.
Thanks"
335,punk,punk,"I‚Äôm 40 and probably too old to even be on this subreddit based on a lot of the posts I see on here, but I was once a teenager skater who listened to way too much punk and hardcore (still do) and want all you high school age kids to realize that the punk scene - or any scene - is easy for assholes to take advantage of.  

One easy example of this are racist bands mimicking punk to recruit people. Another are guys in bands that take advantage of young female fans at shows. Another is when   people in their 20s hang out with teenagers and seem to always need teens to lend them money or buy them drugs- whatever. 

Don‚Äôt be blind. Judge people on who they are, not just the music they listen to."

Hello people of r/punk!
After discovering Yugo-punk, Polish punk, and Turkish punk this February I decided to make a compilation of punk bands from non-english speaking countries (so no US, UK, Canada, Australia, maybe I can a give a pass to New Zealand idk XD). Songs are not necessarily in their own languages, for example KNASH is a Swedish band that sings in English but I love them so much so they're still in the playlist. I'd be super happy if you guys could recommend me bands whose mother tongue isn't English and help me discover different punk scenes. Thanks in advance

PS. I usually don't get enough band recommendations with female leads so I'd really appreciate it if u guys could help me discover more non-english bands with female leads but that isn't necessary if you don't have one in mind."

Since we are travelling so far, we are planning to go to both the North and South date to make it worthwhile. We don't plan on renting a car because of the young driver fees and we don't feel totally comfortable driving on the opposite side of the road. I did some rough research trying to see flights/buses/trains to get from Leeds to London area. I did not have much luck finding something that would line up with festival times. I am wondering if going to both dates is something a lot of people do/is easily done? And if anyone in the UK/anyone that has been in the past has any recommendations on how to get from the first festival date to the second. Thanks!"

669,punk,punk,"Punk has always been about fighting authority over personal freedoms and self liberties.  Its messages always brought us a full perspective of the abuse of power enforced over people.  After listening, I always felt good about myself and that I could accomplish things and have my own opinions...it‚Äôs all about individualism.  Now, I think punk is losing that.  

This is not only happening with punk rock.  It is something that‚Äôs is happening to all types of communication and many are not seeing it.  Instead of pushing the idea of individualism, now I feel it is spreading a monaural sound to have everyone to accept the same ideas.  And if you don‚Äôt follow the herd, then you are not punk.  

Though I like some of the new punk bands, for the most part I ignore its lyrics because they are soft.  They focus more on weaknesses and our strengths.  It has deviated the core message that punk rock has always tried to spread to fight authority and be yourself.  Now it‚Äôs about fighting the current authority and replacing it with another one.

There is nothing punk about none of this...punk has always been about individualism, but now it has turned itself into a herd of the same thing.  So for me, what I used to call punk is dead."

Brand New
Manchester Orchestra
Underoath
Blink-182
Turnover
Citizen
Movements 
And many more if plausible.

2318,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Yo, this description is gonna be very generic, but I am having a hard time finding this song. I listened to it in high school which was 8+ yrs ago and I don't remember any of the lyrics, otherwise I would've found it by now and wouldn't be asking here. It was an emo punk rock song, similar to the sounds of All Time Low and Mayday Parade, but it was neither of these. Its not dashboard confessional or any of these. It was a one hit wonder and not very popular at all, I think it may only have 1m views by now, if that. It wasn't by a very popular band. What I can do, is describe the video. It was an all guy band and the singer had long black hair. The song was about a relationship, like the ins and outs of it and it was describing missing the girl that broke up with him because, I think, she left him for someone else. Some of it was shot on a rooftop, and the rest was depicting events about the relationship. At one point they went to a fair/carnival, and did a picture booth, and it recapped the pics they took. Thats about all that I remember, I hope someone knows what I'm talking about because this has been driving me crazy. It's not on any of these 'top breakup songs' lists so dont bother looking there. I'm pretty sure I would recognize the name instantly, I just can't put my tongue on it. I hope someone can find it because I am missing it like crazy."

125,punk,punk,"I'm looking for snail mail and/or email penpals. 

I'm into British punk 77-84, leather, record collecting, zines, VHS, travel, soccer (football), whiskey, beer, DIY, and old computers.

I'm also into old new wave, and I'm getting interested in 1980s Swedish and Finnish punk.

My favorite bands are the Violators, the Exploited, Riot Squad, Special Duties, Attak, Chron Gen, Infa-Riot, the Plasmatics, Toxic Reasons, Wall of Voodoo, and Devo.

I live in the United States. I am considering immigrating to Canada in the near future.

I eat meat and drink. I don't use drugs or smoke. I respect everyone else's choices on these things, and I am not militant in any regards.

After the pandemic is over, I am hoping to travel in the United States by train, and attend Rebellion in the UK.

My favorite countries to visit are Japan and the UK. I have been to both multiple times. 

I am hoping to correspond with people who share at least a few similar interests."

789,punk,punk,"Yesterday a punk song by an English artist was played on an Australian radio station called triple J. I can remember what the song was called but I thought the artists name was Bob Dylan or something similar. Obviously googling Bob Dylan isn't getting me anywhere. I have tried googling lyrics, nothing. 
The song almost had an English grime rap feel to it but was punk. I fucking loved it buy fear I will never find it!"
881,punk,punk,"These latest generations, and even older ones, have had enough, we have had enough. We grew up with books, films, and series, all telling us that no matter how small, or how insignificant we might seem, we can make a difference. We have grown up with people telling us we can do anything. And we can. We are fighting back against fascism, racism, sexism, homophobia, and oppression. These riots on the street, they're the signs of a populace that has had enough. The BLM movement, The LGBTQ+ Community, Witches, fuck, even the Amish are fighting back. These are the signs of a tired world, tired of citizens being treated less than human. We are angry. And we're fighting back."
3144,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I never thought I would be able to chant ‚ÄúScotty Doesn‚Äôt Know, Scotty doesn‚Äôt know, scottys Gotta go‚Äù. I assumed that era of pop punk was dead, right? That wasn‚Äôt the case whatsoever. Last weekend, I went to a pop punk cover band called ‚ÄúAll American Throwbacks‚Äù who played in this sweaty/beer/teenage angst filled tiny room in Joliet, IL. The floors were sticky. I could feel the sweat from the band. It was so surreal. 

These 3 dudes played their hearts out. They had just such a great time. They were drinking, having a fun time, fucking with the audience, and overall, enjoying their fucking night. There were only a good 10-20 people in that room, but we all were having the time of our lives. We were singing along Blink-182 songs and moshing away. The band made it their own version: they added new lyrics and sped up rather slow Blink songs. They covered everyone from Yellowcard to Green Day to Blink and Lustra. They had their own sound. They had so much energy. They somehow made such a small room feel so full. 

They closed things out with a Blink song. The audience wasn‚Äôt having it. We all chanted ‚ÄúScotty doesn‚Äôt know‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure if the band knew how to play it, they looked a tad bit panicked (they could have been just fucking with us). We kept chanting. They absolutely killed it. They had fun with it. I lost my voice singing along. I questioned the structural integrity of that building, that‚Äôs how fucking dope it was! 

It just feels so great to see that pop punk is still alive. It‚Äôs even better to see younger people still going at it. It‚Äôs way better that I got to experience it in person!"

1249,punk,punk,"I thought it was cool to see what other genres punks listen to! I'm not gonna include like classic rock or grunge cuz I feel like that's a given for a lot of ppl, but I listen to a bit of rap and some pop, but I used to listen to a LOT of R&amp;B and soul/funk. I guess I listen to a lot, but these r my favorite. Lauren hill and Nina Simone, Al Green, feel good happy sounding music just hits right sometimes!"
2198,poppunkers,poppunkers,"They have literally ALWAYS followed popular trends. In the mid-2000s, emo-esque rock was mainstream. So Pete Wentz put on eyeliner and they did that. When that started to fade, they made a much more pop-infused rock record in Folie (their best album imo). Then after the hiatus they followed the trends of what pop rock is today. They've always been trend followers, but that doesn't diminish their music at all. A lot of people on this sub just happen to enjoy older trends more than newer ones, so they see Fall Out Boy as sellouts who hopped on the pop bandwagon. Truth is they've been mainstays there since From Under the Cork Tree. 

So those of you calling Fall Out Boy a pop band just following what's popular, just understand that they've always been that way, and they do it really really well. I can guarantee that if the radio in 2005 sounded like it does today, Fall Out Boy's old music would've been a lot different. Again, I don't think this is a bad thing, since they've consistently taken trends and made solid to great albums out of them. They're my favorite band. I think they've done a good job at maintaining their integrity and respect through it all. But if you think them following current trends in music is a new thing, then you're misinformed. 

I'll admit that they were probably a bit better at following the trends of the 2000s, but if you don't think their last three albums have some gems on them, I don't know what to tell you. Fall Out Boy has always followed trends, but they're damn good at what they do."
1177,punk,punk,"This is an interesting podcast about a guy in his fifties disturbed (and embarrassed in front of his daughter)  by the sexist lyrics in songs he made when he was a young punk; and his lifelong buddy (who is still in the band) who is fine with them.

He was signing two autographs and I waited and shook his hand and handed him some stickers.  Said I was a big fan and the show was great tonight.    He was standing next to former CIA agent -  Jim Semivan the whole time, I was the only one who knew who that guy was.    I wanted to talk to Tom and Jim more about UFOs but it seemed he was in a rush to leave cause it looked like he had to be somewhere.

He estimates that they played roughly 500 shows, and that they had two albums. They weren‚Äôt signed. From what he said they had a decent sized group of kids who would go to their shows , this was vegas in the 90s although they would travel.

Today was the first time I saw it in that sub, so I commented: ""Still weird to me how comfortable model makers are displaying the Nazi and Imperial Japanese flags"".  Got myself a ban for it, I found out they have a rule tucked away where they ban anyone who brings it up;  which to me is creepy as hell.

I've seen a lot of people over the years who say a lot of stuff like ""it's just displaying history"", I'm curious what this sub thinks.  I figured if I'm wrong this is how to find out."

Now that I'm graduating high school, me and some friends decided to take our favorite genre and make band: Punk Face!  There's just one problem...

West Virginia has no punk scene.

We're just four kids from the sticks trying to show the people of Appalachia punk rock.  We want wild gigs with wild fans and to have fun playing music that we enjoy.

Any advice for us?

As to what kind of music we play, it's like a mix of hardcore punk and thrash metal with some elements of country music in the lyrics.  Again, West Virginia, so we're trying to talk about local experiences.  We also occasionally like to make satirical songs making fun of bands like MCR."

Remember that EVERYTHING you do on the net without countermeasures is trackable to your machine. Your cell phone is a machine BTW. 

You have a few options to not just roll burners like a drug dealer but here's the thing, all of them will get you on a list. That's not a bad thing. In fact you should do these things to protect your privacy from everyone that isn't a state actor. Also, the more people who do it, the less the list matters.

Basic level: Get a good paid VPN.
A good paid VPN does not take logs at all, cross reference this with the country they are incorporated in, and the countries you access servers in. There are a lot of people that go super deep into looking into these services. This is the money expensive way.  Research these providers hard. go 20+ years on them.

Option 2 is self hosting and it's a rabbit hole and a half. Can't explain it to you in a post. Basically it involves recreating your services on a secure network you own. Find the sysadmin that is really down for the fight. It is worth it. If you can get someone to get you to option 2 up and running, that basically gets you to insurgency status."

I play in a punk band called Crystal Axis and we're from from Nairobi, Kenya. We're pretty much one of the only African punk bands in existence (the whole African punk scene is pretty tiny with few bands coming up over the years. Our metal scene is absolutely huge though! But I digress)

[Crystal Axis music](https://crystalaxis.bandcamp.com)

We have the opportunity to play an amazing punk festival in London this year called Decolonise Fest and it's a big deal for us for many reasons.
Kenya was colonised by Britain so it's pretty poetic that a punk band from Kenya is getting to play a festival called Decolonise. The festival itself is really important for a band like us because Africa is often overlooked when people talk about punk, metal etc it's looked at as a novelty and few people tend to take it seriously. It's kickass that we get a platform to share our music and our message to an audience that we know will take us seriously.

We're fundraising to make his happen (as you can imagine punks in Kenya aren't exactly the wealthiest ever). It would be rad if y'all could take a second to check it out and consider donating to help us make our dreams come true:
[Fundraising link](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/decolonise-crystal-axis?utm_term=8dZjKzWrm)

Literally any amount helps, if we can get enough people to chip in then I know for certain we can bring some Afropunk magic to the UK.

That aside, I'd love to know what you guys think of our music (streaming link in the post but we're also on Spotify, Apple music etc)
And if anyone would like to talk about the African punk/metal/rock scene I'm all ears and I'd love to have that discussion

Alright, so it's been a few days for us to digest All Time Low's newest single: Some Kind of Disaster. We spent plenty of time putting up with their social media blackout and cryptic teasers throughout the first 20 days of the month, so how are we feeling about it? Was it worth it? 

'Some Kind of Disaster is the comeback single every band strives for' says one well-worded Twitter user (BaraPinkRanger). So far, I honestly haven't met a single person who actually dislikes the song. I can't be the only one finding it hard to not binge the song to the point that I hate it, right? To be fair, the only single knock I can give it is the fact that a few friends and I have some loose plans to create a cover of this absolute bop, yet I'm actually having a lot of trouble hearing the bass. So it's a little difficult for me to play! Despite the painfully long wait, it would seem the majority can agree that the Some Kind of Disaster is indeed great.

Of course, that also means the amount of people sleuthing around the teasers, music video, and old tweets from Alex are hard at work making their theories! What have you found? So far the term 'Life Is Strange' is making an appearance, new album title perhaps?

All in all, we want to know every thought you have on Some Kind of Disaster!

You're still reading? Okay, gotcha. Who's 'we' you ask? I'm Kenna, and I speak on behalf of the Official All Time Low Discord server! If you're still here I'm going to take a wild guess saying that you like All Time Low. Which is great! Because we do too! We would utterly love to have you. We actually just hit 100 members the day before SKoD dropped, we have plenty of celebration plans. I'm going to be real with you here, joining this server was one of the best decisions I've made, as extravagant as that sounds. I have met so, SO many epic people there, and I've found we all have a lot more in common than just a shared love of All Time Low.

1901,punk,punk," 

I always see a sin and always the first one  
No matter how carefull and small it is  
I see it  
and I am always here

I'm spontaneous like a lightning  
I'm the act of nature  
I'm a screw of justice  
That comes to hit the paraph

That I am on the voice  
To be everywhere  
That I cut them after the rope and death rattle  
No mercy, no regrets  
For them my troop is  
the troop of cannibals  
that comes like a wind  
that carry us like a voice  
like the forceful stud followed by dust  
Beyond the horizon

That I'm fucked up like Attila Hun  
and instead of a sword I carry shotgun  
and boom boom - boom when I hear it  
I love that sound and that's when I swear  
I spit! - every new corpse  
and what comes next is clear as daylight  
load the shotgun

Load the shotgun  
I want him to beg, I want him to pray  
I want him to feel, to be in pain  
scum - falls into basket  
before my feet  
I'm the headsman, executor  
The last tutor of sinful people  
Who cuts them simple  
like a strike of the palms  
Load the shotgun

That I'm fucked up like Attila Hun  
That I'm on the voice  
That I'm fucked up like Attila Hun  
That I'm fucked up

In the air flow can be heard and are swinging  
Bones on strings  
Would you, too?!  
Beyond the horizon  
to be excavated by a dog  
and found by birds  
scattered over the ground  
over Your grave  
And that they savour with You?!  
Beyond the horizon

That I'm fucked up like Attila Hun  
That I'm on the voice  
That I'm fucked up like Attila Hun  
Like Attila Hun

2010,poppunkers,poppunkers,"So I know it‚Äôs not much to go on, but it‚Äôs really bugging me that I can‚Äôt remember or find this band I used to always listen to on sunny days. 

Here‚Äôs what I can remember:

It would‚Äôve come out some time between 2010-2015.

The style was like a pop-rock/punk band, I actually think it was kinda like an All Time Low feel, it was definitely generic at the time (probably why I‚Äôm struggling to find them) but they had some good tracks on this album.

The album cover was blue, I think it was the sky but I could be wrong.

The biggest annoyance is that I‚Äôm sure that the album name and the song names were really long names. I also feel that the opening track was the title track, either that or the long name of the title track was the chorus lyric.

It was always in the first third of my iPod list, meaning either the band name or the album name is in the first 1/3rd of the alphabet.

I have a feeling that the band name was around 3 words long. 

I don‚Äôt *think* that they did much after this album, so they may not be putting out music currently.
Could be wrong though. 


Any help would be appreciated! Every year when the sun comes out I think of this band and I just don‚Äôt have enough information to find who they are and listen to them again.

TLDR ; Got some major nostalgia blue-balls, help me decipher this band/album."

3748,punk,poppunkers,Pretty amazing to think there's people at the show younger than the band's been around. Anyway should be a blast!
497,punk,punk,I'm really into their type of music. It's kind of ska but without brass instruments (even though they use them sometimes). Not saying I don't like ska. My favorite thing (about any type of music really) is the harmonizing of vocals. I would love some similar songs/bands that do a lot of harmonizing. I would really appreciate it!
3191,poppunkers,poppunkers,Especially compared the US. I‚Äôm still quite sore about them missing the entire West Midlands off since I live there! :(

265,punk,punk,"I love punk rock, I listen to classic punk, hardcore, thrash, pop punk, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, folk punk, anarchist punk etc., but I just CAN'T listen to ska. I love Operation Ivy and Rancid, I can listen to No Doubt (Mainly bc I got a crush on Gwen Stefani) but I just can't get into ska past that. I've tried listening to the Interrupters because I think everyone in that band is badass and I love that they're getting people into punk again, but I just get really bored listening to them. I just don't enjoy listening to ska, I usually get hate for this from fellow punks, but it just doesn't appeal to me. Anyone else feel this way or is it just me?"

My name is Weasel. I manage a publishing house called Weasel Press ( www.weaselpress.com ) which focuses on queer experiences. I'm fairly new to the punk scene, a friend got me into it with the Dead Kennedys about six years ago.

I've got an anthology of concert stories coming out soon called ""Blood, Sweat and Fists,"" and I'm eager to do more. 

I've been immersed in punk for some time, but I'm interested in learning and writing about queer experiences in punk. 

Although I'm just starting this project, I would love to interview anyone who identifies as queer and punk and hear about their experiences with the scene, the bands, etc.

3020,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hello! I am trying to find a band/song that has been eluding me for years and I was hoping /r/poppunkers could help. 

The only lyrics I can remember is in the chorus, which goes; ""when you're the only one"". Initially, this was a mostly acoustic song, with the band members harmonizing this line, and stretching out the word 'one'. The song was later on another record without the harmonizing.

I have tried searching for the lyrics online, but there's too many songs with those same words. I could've sworn it was by This Providence, but can't seem to find it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

162,poppunkers,punk,This subreddit has done nothing to keep it alive. IS THIS STALE ENOUGH FOR YA?
3356,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Pop Punk isn't doing so well. The good bands have risen to the top and the mediocre bands fell off or broke up. We pretty much know who will stick around. The Wonder Years, The Story So Far, Four Year Strong, Knuckle Puck, and maybe a few others are all that's left from the Late 2000s - early 2010s era. That's the era I'm most familiar with and the scene I was a part of. 

But, I think if any band had the potential to revitalize this genre its gotta be Belmont. Their new singles show some wild creativity. Pop Punk with breakdowns certainly isn't cool anymore but they're doing it and doing it very well. 

What do you guys think? Who else is our best hope?"
610,punk,punk,"Since both these classic albums were released 36 years ago this week, in fact just 2 days apart - Zen Arcade on July 1, 1984
and Double Nickels on the Dime on July 3 - it would be interesting to hear what people think, how well each has aged etc.

I definitely lean more towards Zen Arcade but give all respect to the Minutemen ..."

My friend and I took her dog to a walk like we did everyday, and we live in the woods; no way someone will catch us, we thought. And, when we were roaming through the woods in our street, a bunch of police cars with rotation lights was riding down the streets, 5 meters under us.

I'm a public school teacher in NYC and with schools closed I've decided to teach some classes online to occupy my time.  One class I'm teaching is [Riot Grrrl: Feminist Punk Rock of the 90's](https://outschool.com/classes/riot-grrrl-feminist-punk-rock-of-the-90s-XhCe9jL4?usid=S9usZPyx&amp;signup=true&amp;utm_campaign=share_activity_link) where we'll study the rise of third wave feminism from Anita Hill to the Women's March. Along the way we'll listen to songs from Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, and a few others.  The class is listed for students 13-18 years old, but I can take younger kids who are interested and don't mind some mature lyrics as well!

You can get the class (and many others) for free [here](https://outschool.com/2020-school-closures-offer#usS9usZPyx)

The productions a little flat which is a bummer after they got all the Kickstarter money for a great producer (Cameron Webb) but the songs themselves are great and it's crazy hearing Jer sing again.

2062,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hey so ive been home recording for about a year now but I still cant seem to find the right guitar tone similar to the rythm guitar of a band like Stand Atlantic or Between You and Me. Ive done some research and it seems like my best option would be a JCM 900 amp, but ive listened to some reviews and it doesnt quite sound like a pop punk guitar, if anything it sounds more classic rock. 
Are there any pedals that could give me a pop punk tone?
Also if there is any audio producing/mixing magic thats needed, and info on that would help as well!"

I'm asking on this subreddit since I would like to talk to someone with atleast a similar interest in music. Since I also love the open-mindedness and the ideologies/lifestyles punk usually is associated with, I thought it'd be fitting.

I have other interests too; I like drawing, video games, reading, archery and much more.

1969,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Neck Deep has been one of my favourite bands ever since I was in 8th grade. Life's Not Out To Get You is an album that I still cite as one of my favourite albums of all time, mainly for it's raw energy, honest and uplifting lyrics, and it's overall fun, energetic style and sound.

All Distortions are Intentional has NONE of those things.

It's just such a boring and disappointing album. (Almost) every song on there just sounds like the exact same ""alternative rock"" song with little to no memorable moments OR unsuspecting climaxes and breakdowns, and most of the lyrics just feel incredibly half-assed and cheesy, almost like they should have been saved for a band like Nickelback (I don't hate Nickelback, but come on. Can you really blame me for saying that?)

869,punk,punk,"I've played in a Dutch punkrockband for several years. Our lyrics were always about society, war and skateboarding/surfing. One day we played at a festival in an old German bunker. Upon arrival at the gig, we had some spare time and decided to have a couple of beers outside in the sun, relax and check out the public. Pretty soon we got our eyes on a tall guy in a brown suit who had dressed up as Hitler. 

At that time, I don't think any of us had encountered a Nazi out in the wild. Adding to that we were around 18/19 years old and just made some mocking jokes on him but didn't think much of it for the rest. ""Probably just a lone weirdo"" we assumed. But when it was time to enter the stage for a soundcheck and get up close with the crowd, we entered the bunker and got loudly boo'd by what we could now clearly see was an entire crowd full of right wing extremists. This wasn't a normal festival, this was some disgusting nazi gathering. And they apparently already knew we were anything but right wing.

Some of us wanted to leave but I insisted we stayed, using the argument that these are exactly the type of people that should hear our lyrics. Maybe it would allow us to convert one soul to reason and that would make it worth it.

After the initial booing, the crowd ended up loving the show. I doubt many were aware of the lyrics, but hopefully at least some were.

**My question is, what would you have done?**

Now, half a lifetime later, I sometimes think back and wonder if we made the right choice. I saw a post about Queen this week, that they were blacklisted by the U.N. for continuing to play in South Africa under apartheid. That made me recall the issue.

Also, my dad was a protester, not just during the 60's and 70's, but also later in life when he chaired a group that fought against ""useless violence"" (direct dutch translation) in society. He was very leftist, was invited to speak across the country and one day he did his regular speech, but in front of a crowd of a right wing extremist Dutch political party. He basically had the same thinking as I did, hoping to get in the heads of some of them with a message of tolerance. However afterwards, just because of being present there, he for years was put on a hitlist that could be found online from Antifa. It didn't make sense to him but it was still a bit scary for him cause he was worried they might target his family.

So I'm not sure what is the right way to approach such a matter and am curious as to your thoughts on it!"
3505,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hey guys,

I've been writing my own music since I was a kid but have only recently gotten enough equipment to record on my own. Not top notch stuff but it gets the job done.

Anyway, this is the first song I've done that I've felt good enough about to share online. That being said, it's still pretty raw and that's why I'd love some feedback on anything from structure to mixing to whatever. 

I wrote, recorded, played, and sang the entirety of this song except for the drums which a buddy of mine helped with. It means a lot to me so if you're going to shit on it, that's fine, just include something constructive please. 

Anyway, let me know what you guys think and thanks in advance!

I heard someone saying that they should get Joe from Knuckle Puck as their new frontman. Although I think that would be cool, I don't see that happening. Joe has two musical projects right now with KP and his side-band ***rationale.*** with former Real Friends's vocalist Dan Lambton. And he's really close friends with Dan, so I don't think he'll say yes if he gets the offer, out of pure respect he has to Dan.

3475,punk,poppunkers,I didnt really know where to post this but I was wondering if anyone knew any bands that resemble like vanattica? I've listened to everything they released before they broke up but I need more.
3421,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hello everyone, this post is pretty much summed up within the title but I wanted to give some background as to why I'm asking this. Hopefully it'll spawn some meaningful discussion. I haven't been on here in a while, but I used to post all the time on my old account, u/slchawk. I got locked out of that account and have never been able to get back into it, that's another story for another day. But in my time on this subreddit between both accounts I've noticed that a lot of new bands that try to post material on here often stay buried underneath all of the music videos and things that get posted about the bigger bands. A lot of new bands never seem to get many upvotes or comments at all, let alone crack the front page, and that's got to hurt a lot if you're a pop punk band that doesn't make a splash on a pop punk subreddit.

There was, however, one band that seemed very different, at least for a short period of time. Boxford, a band out of Virginia Beach, made it to the front page with one of their music videos or singles, and the subreddit ate it up. It was a huge day for them, making such a splash, and it was inspiring to me since I am a musician/songwriter myself. I loved the few tunes they had on Spotify and bumped them all the time. I don't know if any of you guys have kept up with them, but unfortunately they announced that they were breaking up today. I was able to talk to their drummer a little bit today and found out that one of the reasons they had to end things was that it's just so hard to make it anywhere as a new band nowadays. He said the market is so saturated and being someone who is interested in these types of things, it does sometimes seem like to me that as ""the new era of pop punk bands"" have cemented themselves in everyone's minds, it's hard to determine when/if there will be a fourth major wave. (First being like: Green Day, blink, Sum 41, etc. Second being easycore/genre blending stuff like ADTR and FYS, third being TSSF, Knuckle Puck, Grayscale, Neck Deep, etc).

My question to you is, being someone who is going to release my first record ever in the coming months, what do you guys look for? How can I make sure that I'm not buried with the others? Of course I believe my songwriting talent's there, I feel like the songs are passionate and catchy yet have an edge... Some of them have been songs I've worked on for years --- but how do people like myself and others reach you guys without it feeling inauthentic or forced? What do you like to see in new bands? I've got several albums songs written already and I want to get as many of them as I can out there. Doing this DIY is rewarding and fun, but it's admittedly scary too.

So I was just wondering; what do you guys really look for? It seems like a simple question but I think it's a lot more than just the sound... Lots to think about and discuss here, hopefully ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any and all recommendations.

*Disclaimer* I'm not saying Boxford failed, by the way. They played Warped Tour and that's one of those things that can never be taken away. I love their music and it blows that they had to split but life has different plans for different people. I'm just polling others' opinions on what causes so many bands to never get traction and what you guys like to see."

924,punk,punk,"Just to be clear, I am not for police brutality and I am also not for looting and setting business on fire that have done no wrong BUT I am very glad to see that Americans have some fight in them. I was getting worried that the majority of Americans would be too afraid to stand against the system if needed. Apparently I was wrong :)   
Be safe out there!"
262,punk,punk,"Thrift stores are no longer an option for me as my area is now heavily gentrified, so they are more expensive and carry less clothing, not that they would carry anything I'm looking for beyond workboots and flannel.

I'm looking for sites that sell inexpensive clothing, especially ones that sell stuff in a similar vein as  bondage pants, super tight pleather pants, jackets, and button downs. 

Even websites that carry basic clothing is appreciated, but I'm mostly just looking for sites that sell jeans for less than $100 (many of the places I've been recommended do charge upwards of that ): )."
240,punk,punk,"My band, No Brainer, just released our new single, Glutton For Punishment. We recorded, mixed, shot, and edited this entire video ourselves. How many music videos are shot completely from the inside of a refrigerator? Check it out and let me know what you think!

The band is a mix of screaming and singing vocals. The music video starts as (I think) the singer lighting a cigerette towards the camera in a large field with a car a decent distance behind him. He lights the cigerette then the car explodes. The music starts and then the rest of the music video has mobster/integration vibes.

Ideologies aside, aside from their actions (pushing boundaries, playing music that was outside the ordinary, outside of what was cool back then) are Talking Heads punk? Genre-wise, sound-wise, and why. If they were to come out on the scene today as a local band, would they be considered punk?"
126,punk,punk,"Hey guys
I write for a Nairobi based blog named Heavy and the Beast, traditionally we've focused largely on all things punk, metal and rock with a focus on Africa and African bands. Recently we've been expanding and covering international bands and releases too, I'd love to cover more bands for the site and I'm always looking out for anything interesting.

Here's the site:
https://heavyandthebeast.co.ke/

If you have any new music out, or coming out soon, please link me and I'll take a listen, if we dig it either myself or another writer will cover it and share on the site and our socials.

We don't pull in millions of readers, atleast not yet, but you'll get your music covered and exposed to a whole new audience too (people don't realise that there's a burgeoning African punk scene with loads of dedicated fans)

Hit me up!"

3459,poppunkers,poppunkers,"To me, Living Proof feels like a B-side compilation to ATWAB and their cover of ""Real World"" feels like too easy of a song to play in their case. They're getting a lot of praise, but I don't feel that they deserve it based on the quality of the output. And touring with the world's most basic and edgeless Pop Punk band didn't help them either. I'm worried that they're not going to push themselves to do something crazy different from the last two albums. They've put themselves in a bubble they don't want to leave. Does anyone else think this?"

1469,punk,punk,"So to me a lot of being punk is expression. Through punk I express my dissatisfaction with the government, the world, hierarchies, people, and society in general. I‚Äôve only gotten in to the punk scene a little less than a year ago and since then I‚Äôve been going deeper and deeper. At first I just liked the music and beer, then the people, and then the politics. I have a battle jacket and wear chains. However my battle jacket has sleeves and I won‚Äôt be able to wear it since it‚Äôs starting to warm up. I‚Äôm looking for help on expressing myself the same way in the summer months. I don‚Äôt want to go back to wearing normal clothes."

We‚Äôve hit some of the bigger ones , MRR, Razorcake, etc. Does anyone know places that will accept copies if we send them?  Appreciate any help anyone is willing to give.

But now I kinda like the style but, I'm a complete idiot on what punk culture is like, I'm quite young and don't really have that much experience with punk, so what's a good start? I know punk is about not giving a fuck, but I'd like to know more about punk as a culture."

As I was queueing, a gray-haired lady who worked there waved at me and shouted, ""That's from back in my day!""
This lady was in her 60s at least.
I was confused, and didn't know what she was talking about.
She then shouted to me, ""BARMY ARMY!!""

I was wearing an Exploited ""Punk's not Dead"" shirt.

We talked about the band, how she'd seen them before back in her day, and how they were still going.

I live alone. This was the first real human interaction I've had in weeks.

I walked out of the store, trying to hide the fact I had tears of pride rolling down my face. My first time speaking to another human in 5 weeks, and my shirt was the thing to trigger it.

I'm sat at home now a good few hours later, still emotional about what happened.

2580,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I found this pretty interesting... Does anybody remember Hawk Nelson from back in the day? They had (what I think are) two really great pop-punk records come out: Letters To The President (2003) and Smile, It's the End of the World (2006). I was 13 and 16 when they came out so maybe me being young had something to do with me liking them more because they were pretty polarizing for being one of those Christian bands that's not, but definitely is. You know what I mean? Like, ""We're not a Christian band; we're Christians in a band,"" like MxPx or Five Iron Frenzy. So that meant the punk scene didn't always like them because they were too Christian and the Christian scene didn't always like them because they were too punk...

Anyway, I liked those two albums even though i look back at them now as the poor man's MxPx. Well they put out five records total from 2003 up until 2013 as the pop punk group and then frontman Jason Dunn left the band, the guitarist Jon Steingard was moved up from lead guitars to frontman and they rebranded a contemporary CCM (Christian contemporary) group. It was so strange, but by the time they did that I had long quit listening. I remember giving their third and fourth album each a listen and being underwhelmed. I still dig those first two. If nothing more, they're nostalgic.

Which brings me to why I'm posting and wondering if any of you know anything about any of this. I remember Jason leaving so abruptly and couldn't tell if it was actually amicable or if it was just positive ""don't burn bridges"" PR from both sides... I just remembered all of this for some reason and tried to do some digging and can't find anything. Jason doesn't follow any of the original members or new members of Hawk Nelson on Instagram and none of them follow him. Even more bizarre considering that I know Daniel Biro, the bassist and only original member left, was a groomsman in Jason's first wedding and Jason was one in his. I just find that so odd and wonder if any of you remember any of this or have any info."

Dave Swanson targets YOUNG GIRLS of color to manipulate and abuse   
I want to talk about my story because apparently it's okay to take advantage of young girls, lie about drug use, lie about STDs, and deny all forms of cheating and abuse!  

Dave and I saw eachother when I was into the scene in chicago and he told me he was in a band which I don't remember but it was a number (Fact check i dont fucking remember) and a band with his ex girlfriend who I have  never met.

Dave is really sweet at first and is like your best friend right off the bat, he makes you feel comfortable, he tells you his stories, tells you how much he cares about you and introduces you to all his friends. Now that I remember everything CLEARLY i can't believe this guy has friends from all the lying and manipulative things he did.

Dave was talking to another person right before I stopped hearing from him and, he did it to the next girl (who contacted me somehow) and Im sure hes done it again and again. He is abusive as hell, as soon as I got to know him being around him was like being around a bomb. AND NOTHING IS HIS FAULT, every time he explodes at you its because ""hes loud or had a bad day or he is having panic attack"" He makes you believe he is an accepting guy but is secretly judging you and everyone he knows he talks shit about. I thought he was just kidding but he even talks shit about these two girls that he calls them best friends. He was open about him being addicted to heroin but because I was young and dumb, we didnt use condoms and I got an STD. Later on I told my now boyfriend he started asking me questions about him. Then my bfs friends and my friends started asking me questions about him. I was confused because I was over him but apparently being with him made me weirder.

Guess what I went to therapy and realized: Dave Swason is a manipulator, he gets you to spend money on him, he uses his trauma to get exactly what he wants, he cries to gaslight you, he steals from you (over $100 worth of thstuff), he lies to you about body safety (he gave me STD AND didnt tell me he was doing sex for money WHILE WE WERE DATING), he lies to his friends in front of your face and then tells you why later, he uses people for their house, for their drugs, for their attention.  He tells you he is not racist, homophobic, or sexist but he makes ALL THOSE JOKES and says someone else said them, he talks LIKE A PIG about womens bodies, he is not a safe person. He has never been a safe person. TELL YOUNG GIRLS AND ALL GIRLS THAT DAVE SWANSON IS AN ABUSER. It would not surprise me if I was not the only one and It would not surprise me to learn that he has did rapey acts before. 

I dont want to get too explicit to preserve mine and my boyfriends privacy but Dave manipulates people into sex and lies to you about his clean status. I have been recovering from my BRIEF time with him ever since because it was sooooo hiddenly traumatizing. I am speaking out because I now have the words to talk about the abuse that went on. A girlfriend should NOT have to talk to down from hurting yourself because I said something that made you feel bad, a girlfriend should NOT have to find out you are doing drugs behind her back and not caring for safety (uses needles), a girlfriend should not have to find out that you were sleeping around doing sex for money, a girlfriend should not have to feel scared everytime you are mad, a girlfriend should not have to PAY for everything even though you said you had a job, a girlfriend should not have to get STDs as a surprise from you, a girlfriend should not have to see you treat everyone like shit, a girlfriend should not have to feel so manipulated that you don't know which way is up.

When I met dave he told me that people didn't like him, that he learned from his past, and that I can trust him. WRONG. I will say he is an abuser, liar, and puts people at risk for STDS. My friend and BF are saying that he is a sexual assaulter because of the stories i told them around sex (he would convince me to do things i didnt want to) and because he didnt use condoms when i would ask, AND because he was doing sex for money without telling me. I know he seems like he has changed but he hasnt until he starts ADMITTING how much of a slimeball he is. 

The reason im posting this is for 3 reasons:  1) Dave gave me an STD and because I didnt know what was wrong with me so long it got worse if he told me he was cheating or doing sex for money i could have gotten help sooner

2) because I know how people around him don't think hes capable of this, IM TELLING YOU HE IS, HE HAS PROBABLY LIED AND STOLEN FROM YOU TOO

3) because my friend ran into someone during covid that used to be friends with his ex girlfriend and told me HOW HE ABUSED HER PHYSICALLY TURNED HER ONTO DRUGS AND WAS SO SO SO MANIPULATIVE

This is a grown man not a child, he can answer what he did, and BECAUSE i know he won\\t I want everyone to know so atleast girls stay safe. Thank you.

I‚Äôll preface this with: I‚Äôve been a diehard fan of TDS since ‚Äò08, I‚Äôve bought all their albums, bought some Merch a few times, and have been to two shows. I love this band.

However, ever since Mother Nature, there‚Äôs been a lot, and I mean a lot, of references to drug use and the state that drugs put you in. On Mother Nature, 7 out of 10 songs have multiple drug references, and it‚Äôs more than just weed. They just started a record label named ‚ÄúMolly Water Music‚Äù, an obvious ode to MDMA. The music and melodies have been stellar, and I enjoy the lyrics and vocals, but its beginning to be a little much. I am praying this next EP isn‚Äôt all about drugs and psychedelic states. Maybe i was too young to notice, but RFTS and War Paint were so pure and heartfelt. I feel like i‚Äôm alone in this opinion, but I had to just say it. Lastly, AJ frequently posts stories on IG about drugs and smoking. I truly hope he‚Äôs doing okay through all this. 

And, i‚Äôm not super anti-drug or anyrhing; it‚Äôs just a constant overload and I‚Äôm feeling myself having difficulty relating to the music now."

I understand Jerry Finn added some rhythm guitar while mixing/producing. I'm not sure, but vocals may have been brushed up on as well in the studio.

I'm just wondering how different the album sounds compared to actually being on the floor at the show. I am assuming people who attended the show went and bought the album the following year when it released given it was a live recording of a show they went to.

Did you remember if the show sounded as good as it does on the album? 

For the record, everyone involved with this album did a fantastic job. IMO, one of the best live albums out there."

I'm not sure if this is the right place to mention this, but I've been struggling to decipher the lyrics of this song. The singer's voice is fairly hard to hear and there's  no documentation I've been able to find on the band. This video on youtube is actually the only place i'm able to find the song, except on spotify where it's somehow attributed to Oi Polloi as ""Thugs In Uniform."" (despite it not sounding remotely similar)

Can anyone here make out the lyrics? Or does anyone know where they could be found?"

1434,punk,punk,"Okey, forget the virus, some picture about the state before everything went down. Like a map of the concerts, filtered maybe with genres.

If that isn't possible, what are the most played genres there in USA? Folk Punk have all the young generations? Midwest Emo and PostHardcore are played regularly? Or the big names are the most touring people (Nofx, Bad Religion, The Casualties). Ska Punk still exist? And so on... feel free to write an overview if you want.

Here in Spain we still have some concerts. Although punk have decreased in the ""alternatives town fests"" (every town have some days to a weeks with concerts outside, dancing, food, cultural things every year), there have been an increasing of profesional festivals (with the same famous and mostly old bands). We still have some squats in the big cities, specially in Barcelona and Madrid, with some concerts. But seems that the genre is a little bit stagnant (besides Crim, they are crazy guitar mf and angry as hell, but I'm tired to see them). Seems that the alternative music here have shifted to urban music (mostly transfeminists reggaeton, dancehall and trap, they have a lot of actitude and have a good revolutionary message, but mostly not my thing)"

61,punk,punk,"I got into the punk community a few months ago. It really helped my confidence, finding music and a community that puts sound and visuals to the anger I feel. It's awesome! I went from a conservative tradwife to a bigender anarchist.

I found my new gender and I felt really free. Except after the honeymoon phase wore off I realized how scared I was about transitioning in the south with a conservative family. I've been ignoring it. Listening to hardcore shit whenever I felt insecure and clowning about it to my friends. I'm punk! I don't care what others think. Right?

Well it all came to a head today. I finally told my friends how scared I am. How I'm worried about the struggle I'll have to face to be myself. And to lighten the mood I said ""I know it's not punk rock but I'm really really fucking scared.""

And my friend said ""You don't have to be punk rock right now."" and it made me goddamn cry. He's right. It's okay to not be punk rock sometimes. Sometimes you have to cry and be scared, but afterwards you put your boots on and kick some skulls in. Let's not let punk be alternative toxic masculinity, it's okay to cry."

I tell people I‚Äôm the oldest pop-punk kid. I‚Äôm a grown ass man with a mortgage and a wife and all of that, and I‚Äôve never seen a time when it feels like female led bands have been represented so heavily in the scene. 

Meet me @ the Alter may be the best new band in a decade in my opinion.  I feel like they are coming on the scene as strong musically as New Found Glory was when Catalyst came out, and lyrically as strong as Man Overboard was on their self titled album ( I feel like I am alone in not having an issue with MOBs lyrics. They wrote songs about things we all went through and I‚Äôve met literally hundreds of people who have talked to me about how MOB lyrics hit them in the times the needed it. But I am a Stan for them and lucky enough to call those guys friends so is am incredibly fucking biased about this) 

Stand Atlantic have really started pushing the boundaries of what is pop punk., but doing it with the spirit of the scene. Lavender Bones is my favorite full length since 2016 and all of the new tracks are so strong. I find my self listening to Hate Me, Shh and Wavelength for the first time and not super digging them, but knowing they‚Äôre amazing and then around the third I‚Äôm embarrassing my daughter as we are stopped at a red light. 

The interrupters seems just fucking great. Fight the Good Fight is such a strong album and is so well done that it always feels fun even when tackling harder subject of life, including death and the legacy we leave behind to those we love.  

And then you have all the other amazing bands. 


Hot Milk is absolutely killing it. 

Yours truly is amazing. 

Courage My Love 

Candy Hearts 

There‚Äôs just so many great bands, and it feels amazing that the foundations laid by Cherry Bomb and all its members, Patti Smith, Blondie, X-ray Specs, Letters to Cleo, The Donnas, The Distillers and Paramore laid down is the road these bands are leading the charge down in 2020."

Accordingly, with the kind permission of the Mods here, we're doing a May Madness Bagpipe Bracket poll. Today I'm posting six different brackets of bagpipes, and you can vote for the bracket holding the bagpipes that you feel most epitomize the Punk Ethos. Next Friday will be a new bracket with one pipe per bracket, and the following Friday I will announce the winner. There are over 100 kinds of bagpipes out there, from Portugal to India, and Reddit has 14 different subreddits for bagpipes. So let's listen to some music together and decide: **which pipes are most punk???**

&amp;#x200B;

* [r/Bockpfeife](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bockpfeife/) (German) and  [r/Cornemuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornemuse/) (French and Breizh/Bretagne)
* [r/Gaita](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaita/) (Spanish/Catalan/Portuguese) and [r/Zampogna](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zampogna/) (Italian)
* r/UilleannPipes (Irish) and  [r/WelshBagpipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WelshBagpipes/) (also covers Cornish and English)
* r/Bagpipes (Scottish, Highland/Smallpipes/Borderpipes) and  [r/NorthumbrianSmallpipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthumbrianSmallpipe/) (Northern England)
* [r/SwedishBagpipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwedishBagpipes/) (and other Baltic) and [r/Volynka](https://www.reddit.com/r/Volynka/) (Russian/Ukrainian and Caucasus)
* [r/Gaida](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaida/) (Balkans), [r/Habban](https://www.reddit.com/r/Habban/) (North Africa and Middle East) and [r/Mashak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mashak/) (South Asia)

Note r/ElectronicBagpipes are not in the running because they're generally an emulator of a specific family of bagpipe. So choose your champion for the first bracket, and check back next Friday to see who made it to the finals!

I still don't get the hype for GG anyway. These same people I know who are GG fans are advocates against abuse, rape, and every other terrible thing you can advocate against. GG was all of those things. He was a rapist, an abuser, beastiality, possible pedophile/hebophile..literally everything bad mixed into one.

900,punk,punk,"This is not a follow up or a brag post about me being vegan. BUT. I THINK. One of the most punk things you can do, is have a non animal, plant based diet. When you think about punk,  two things come to mind. The music, and the politics. Now, the main idea behind punk politics, has always been putting someone else before you. My question is, how does that differ from another living bean, non human or not? Is the taste that addictive, that you wont consider artificially impregnating a cow rape? Because it's not human? Does rape only count IF it's a human being? 

Personally, I think the whole idea of punk, entails putting someone else before yourself, human or not, and sticking to your guns. I just want to know what everyone thinks. I would LOVE genuine conversation and debate. Fuck off with the hate. The insults. Just the genuinely shithead comments that the internet generates. Lwts be civil. I'm not trying to convert.

2568,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I'm going to be frank, I love chatting about music genres. I don't get the hate for it. Identifying traits in music and categorizing it is fun for me. So, with that preface, I want to say this is all meant in the spirit of fun and really just to get some discussion going. 

I would describe myself as a punker, first and foremost‚Äîwhether my fellow punks agree or not (I'm into mostly melodic punk, Hot Water Music, The Menzingers, BTMI!, Against Me!, etc., etc.). Pop punk, to me, is just a subgenre of the stuff I dig with roots all the way back to the Ramones. Usually with a focus on melodic vocal lines and chugging buzzsaw guitars. Screeching Weasel, Green Day, Teenage Bottlerocket, all the way to what I would consider the modern pop punk groups like Direct Hit!, Off With Their Heads, Goodbye Blue Monday, and Tightwire. Now, read through those bands and make sure to comment which bands are more indicative of the genre, I'll wait. 

Now, here is where I got turned for a loop at some point. The bands I know as pop punk are basically just a subgenre of punk, i.e. they also tour with typical punk bands, but somewhere along the line I became aware of a world that doesn't really touch my own often‚Äîa veritable pop punk scene. Here's what I'm talking about: bands like Four Year Strong, A Day to Remember, All Time Low, Boston Manor, New Found Glory, Knuckle Puck. I know nothing about these bands and to me, they are alien and strange. This is not the pop punk I know, and now, with 30 approaching, I am old and scared. 

I'm not hating on them, by the way, I'm just super curious here. Here we have two groups of pop punk bands, and to my mind they don't really interact with each other much (would love examples of the opposite being true though). 

So, let's talk about our experiences. As a fan of one half of the genre, what is your impression of the other half?

Anyone like both?

 Where did the split in these groups happen?

Where do modern emo outfits like Origami Angel and Hot Mulligan fit in?

Any bands that fit into both sides of the coin (my guess here is maybe The Wonder Years?)?

Let's talk shop!"
1414,punk,punk,"My punk lifestyle identification came as a reaction to the world around me as I perceived it. 

Like everyone, the things I was taught at impressionable times in my life helped establish my value system. That value system was challenged by the world around me from as far back as I can remember. 

My reaction has been to withdraw from societal norms into myself. 

The groups of people I‚Äôve felt comfortable around have tended to be punks. It feels my antisocial tendencies have led me to feel more at home in punk culture. It just feels right. The music is urgent and unapologetic and I appreciate those things in music. 


Was it your upbringing, did the music attract you, was it the people you were around, did you come upon the ideology independently and learn to appreciate it, did politics bring you in, or perhaps another activity such as skating, or was it something else entirely? It‚Äôd be lovely to discuss. Please feel free chime in.

Thank you and fuck off!  Haha

# 1. Practice your songs to a click

Unless you are recording a LIVE album, practicing your music to a metronome makes overdubbing or any sort of correction in **Post-Production** incredibly easy. I know many engineers that will not record without a click simply to avoid the headache. If your musical group has music (*or a drummer*) that fluctuates between tempos, you need to rehearse the music to per-determined **BPM** before showing up to your session.

# 2. Show up Prepared

My opinion is: A great studio session is one that runs quickly and efficiently. If you and your band mates are pressured into last minute problems or troubleshooting (*such as vocal delivery, guitar melody, or rhythm section misalignment*), it can be a real strain on the recording process.

If you are looking to become a session musician, remember this saying: ***You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared.***

# 3. Recording a Song is like building a house

Before you even get to work on the house, you spend hours designing and planning. This is the **Pre-Production Phase**. Finally, you are ready to bring a construction crew to your site of choice‚Ä¶ This is your arrival at the Studio. You put down the foundations first, within the context of the greater plan of the house. This is why drums and bass are the first to record, within the context of a scratch guitar or melody track. Next, you put up walls and a roof, essentially closing off the creative box in which you will work. This is the main identifying characteristic of the song (or house), such as lead melodies and vocals, or lead guitar. From there, you add finishing touches ‚Äî nice railings on the stairs, windows, drywall, insulation, and paint. These are finer details that reinforce the greater creative goal of the song, such as vocal harmonies, horn lines, solo sections, time-based effects, percussion, and texture.

### From my experience, I like to organize my **Recording Process** like this:

1. **Drums + Bass**
2. **Pad** (Rhythm Guitar + Keys) ‚Äî OR
3. **Melody** (Vocals, guitar, keys, whichever instrument is playing the melody)
4. **Harmony** (Horn section, backing vocals, etc)
5. **Texture** (ambience, percussion, overdubs)

And then of course at any time, any and all of these elements can be re-recorded (*exception here:* ***drums***), edited, moved around, spliced, played backwards, etc.

# 4. You can always add reverb and delay, but it is impossible to get rid of.

Most likely, your mix engineer will add reverb and delay properly. However, some artists are adamant that they know best:

### Scenario 1:

Let‚Äôs say you are in a Dream Pop band that has vocals running through a highly saturated vocal effects pedal. Your singer absolutely nails the take of the chorus, except for one thing: the singer accidentally smacks the microphone with their hand because of their \*sick dance moves\*. If you are only recording the vocal signal **wet** (*with effects*) as opposed to **dry** (*without effects*), not only are you recording the physical smack of the microphone, but you also are recording the 2 seconds of reverb that comes after. If you recorded Dry, you can easily edit out the hit and saturate the dry vocals with effects in Post. But if you recorded Wet, this becomes a brutal challenge for even the best engineer.

Mixing Engineers agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove any amount of reverb or delay on a recorded instrument. Which is why we record dry signals and send the performer a wet signal in their monitor mixes. We make separate tracks for important, time-based effects like reverb and delay, and give those effects their own adjustable levels and parameters for real-time monitoring without affecting the integrity of the dry vocal track.

### Scenario 2:

You are the keyboard player of an indie rock band and you are playing a Rhodes. The built in tape delay on your Korg SV1 Keyboard is pretty great! So, you slap it on. Turns out, your delay timing is too long and too prominent in the context of the mix. Unfortunately, in this scenario there is nothing the engineer can do to fix that. ***With any and all time-based effects, you want to start small and build big, or use none at all***. You can always re-amp the clean signal or re-record the instrument with effects to taste.

# 5. Re-amp your guitars for the perfect tone

### Scenario 3:

You are in a Heavy Metal Band. Your guitar player take a 4 bar solo before the Pre-Chorus Breakdown. The amount of Gain and Distortion on this solo must be absolutely Perfect ‚Äî and while your effects may be incredibly dialed in to your ear, the Engineer always has a different perspective. So the Engineer will split the recording process into two parts:

**Re-Amping** is a non-destructive process of recording a clean tone (usually through a DI box straight from the Guitar) and then re-recording that clean signal into a guitar amp &amp; Pedal effects separately over top of the song at a later time. This gives the band and Engineer the opportunity to fine-tune the gain, distortion, compression and any other effects to perfection without compromising the initial take.

[DI Box](https://i.imgur.com/Fmr88Jt.jpg)

Many engineers split the initial guitar tone and record both a **wet** &amp; **dry** signal, especially in genres of heavily affected guitars (*like Metal, Rock and Roll, Pop, &amp; Psychedelic Rock*). All musicians hold a bias towards the sound of their instrument as it appears to them *while they play*. Which is why when a guitarist hears their own wet take played side by side in context of the full mix, they many times choose the engineer‚Äôs.

# 6. Understand the Concept of the ‚ÄúMix Space‚Äù

1. ***Kick Drum*** ‚Äî center bottom
2. ***Snare*** ‚Äî lower center, left side
3. ***Cymbals*** ‚Äî Shimmering over top, spread wide
4. ***Pad*** ‚Äî fills in the stereo image
5. ***Lead melody*** ‚Äî loud and proud, center center
6. ***Rhythm guitar*** ‚Äî center, panned appropriately
7. ***Bass*** ‚Äî sandwiched between the Kick Drum Low and High

[Blues Band Mix Space ‚Äî Globe Institute of Recording &amp; Production](https://i.imgur.com/QoSfpm0.jpg)

# 7. Make a recording schedule

What days do we do this? What days do we do that? Making a schedule allows you to keep track of your timeline and your budget!

It also helps to keep the recording engineer prepared. Here‚Äôs an example:

1. Wednesday = Load In, Set up
2. Thursday = Drums, Bass, Rhythm Section
3. Friday = Vocals, Melody
4. Saturday = Solo Sections, Re-Amping
5. Sunday = Textures, ambience, transitions, finishing touches

# 8. Agree on who wrote the song.

This is important for two reasons ‚Äî 1. Publishing rights (who takes credit and royalties for the intellectual property of the songwriting) and 2. Who has final say on any creative and technical decisions in the studio, on that song. Knowing who wrote the song will help the Engineer appropriately direct questions and concerns in a 1 on 1 style, instead of towards the whole band (which can lead to time-consuming debate.) This is not a huge deal, but I personally like to be aware of the creative dynamic of whose input is more valuable than others. I‚Äôm really only adding this because part of being a recording engineer is working within the dynamic of a group of creative individuals, and you don‚Äôt want to accidentally disturb it. And I‚Äôve seen some arguments for sure‚Ä¶ moving on.

# 9. No family members or friends while tracking

Please leave your parents and siblings at home. I generally welcome significant others (*because spouses/partners of professional musicians ‚Äúget it‚Äù*) but if your companions in the studio are distracting an engineer while they are working (*or worse, distracting the musician while you are working*), the Engineer might ask them to leave‚Ä¶. its not vacation time for your Engineer. Its ***get-work-done-time***.

# 10 Leave the Drama (and the drugs) at the Door

As a general rule, keep your distractions away from the Engineer. Recording is a very stressful and methodical task. If you‚Äôve got a joint, take it outside. If you‚Äôve got beef with a band mate‚Ä¶

[Yeah, thats gonna be a no from me, dawg](https://i.imgur.com/7ZF9HxL.png)

# 11. Don‚Äôt steal our Gaff tape, that stuff is expensive.

\*guilty\*

# 12. Most performance-related flaws can be fixed in post

Miss a note on the solo? **Edit it in post.** Vocalist didn‚Äôt deliver that line quite right? **Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs 12 other takes**. Not enough Reverb? **I Give it the ole‚Äô Re-Amp treatment.** Kick drum is off beat? **Copy, Paste, baby!** Efficiency is the name of the game in the recording process.

*(also, click* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXfK9Osmvs) *if you don't understand the Troggs reference below.... GOLD)*

[The Troggs](https://i.imgur.com/wLu0tiv.jpg)

# 13. However, two things must be addressed immediately: Time and Pitch

This is an objective issue that can foil the recording process. If your engineer tells you that you are either: **Rushing/Dragging** or **Out of Tune**, be cognizant that this small flaw can jeopardize the track later in the Recording Process (when *you add elements like harmony, melody, and texture*).

Which leads nicely into the next tip:

# 14. Tune your instruments in between takes

Please bring a tuner to the session. In general, you should be ultra-aware of your tempo (*if you are a member of the rhythm section*) and your tuning/intonation (*if you are a member of the melody section*).

# 15. Do some exercise/stretches in between takes

This is really important ‚Äî Exercising in between takes can significantly increase everyone‚Äôs mood and energy going back into the studio. You can actually hear the difference in the takes. Not to mention it can help relieve all that stress and any pent up aggression you have towards your band mates. Not only is exercise good for not having a heart attack when you are 50, it‚Äôll actually make the recording process much smoother and make the takes themselves better (*in my opinion*).

[Relevant BoJack is Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/JEKZZed.png)

# 16. Show up prepared‚Ä¶ to wait

1. 75% of your time will be spent sitting and waiting, or listening to your band mates record, so bring something to keep you occupied but that won‚Äôt take you out of the zone. I recommend a video game that you love but that is also something that you can put down in an instant and that you aren‚Äôt really invested in. Something simple, like Mario Kart or Super Smash Brothers, or even a Pok√©mon game.
2. If you want to stay in a creative vibe, I recommend bringing something to draw or doodle with. Put on some headphones and go dance outside. (We have a Rubix cube that sees a lot of love)
3. The most important thing is not to bring something that will remove you from the mindset of the studio environment. I certainly do not recommend bringing your day job! I‚Äôve heard many times: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just bring my computer and knock out some emails for my Marketing job while I wait for everyone to finish tracking‚Äù. This is a bad idea ‚Äî it will remove you from the headspace that you, the creative artist, need to be in to make the most out of your time and your engineer‚Äôs time. Unless it is related to the Band (*ordering merchandise, responding to Promoters, confirming show details*, *etc*), I would leave it at home.

# 17. Beware of Burrito-itis

Pretty self-explanatory.

# 18. Hot tea makes a good coffee substitute for long recording sessions, but water is even better.

Staying Hydrated is super important, it‚Äôll keep you focused for the longer sessions, not to mention being hydrated is just awesome in general. Also, make sure your vocalist knows about **Throat Coat**, that stuff is the mamma-jammas

[Throat Coat](https://i.imgur.com/lhtmVV0.jpg)

# 19. The engineer is not your enemy

The Recording Engineer has one job: ***Be the bridge that transfers the highest quality version of your music into the physical world***. This manifests itself differently from producer to producer‚Ä¶ some engineers are technical producers and some engineers are people producers. It‚Äôs a balance of therapy and tough love, tech savvy &amp; emotional capacity, having the mental fortitude to keep going and the discipline to know when you‚Äôve gone far enough. The bottom line ‚Äî The Engineer is just doing what they believe is the best thing for the final product. So if your engineer delivers constructive criticism to you, such as ‚Äú*That take was a decent take, but I can hear the energy level dropping a bit. Let‚Äôs take 15 and regroup*‚Äù‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take it personally.

# 20. Bring your A-Game

Aside from the mental discipline needed for an efficient and productive studio session, I argue that every musician should take their instrument to the shop to get ‚Äútuned-up‚Äù before you begin your session.

1. **Guitarists**: a tune-up can address problems such as: Buzzing frets, Intonation problems, and Electrical noise, and will usually set you up with a set of fresh strings
2. **Vocalists**: Don‚Äôt go partying the night before and lose your voice plz &amp; thx ‚Äî signed, everyone.
3. **Drummers**: Put on new heads before the session and tune your drums every couple hours. Double check the chains on your kick and hi-hat pedals.
4. **Producers**: Check that all your cables, sound cards, interfaces, controllers and adapters are working before coming into the studio. We may not have what you need!
5. **Everyone else**: Don‚Äôt make fun of the drummer for tuning their kit, just be proud that they showed up at all (kidding :P)

# 21. The #1 goal should be capturing the energy of the performance

There is an indescribable rush of emotion and power that arises from well-performed and recorded music. It‚Äôs like tasting your mom‚Äôs signature dish, or watching a group of fighter jets dance in the skies. Where just for a moment, you forget about all the technical barriers and frustrations and troubleshooting‚Ä¶ you forget to monitor the faders on your console or the dB levels on your mic pre-amps‚Ä¶ and you sit back in awe at the musical masterpiece crafted in front of you. And you look down at your computer screen and watch with a smile as that energy is grasped from the ephemeral and poured like concrete into your hard drive. It‚Äôs the absolute best part about being an engineer ‚Äî Capturing the joy and energy and‚Ä¶ well, the magic.

# 22. Don‚Äôt suck, Have fun

I‚Äôm gonna get a tattoo of this one day.

I love my classics like DK, Black Flag, Minor Threat, Sex Pistols etc. but also really love some poppier stuff like Neck Deep and Blink-182. Does that make you ""less of a punk"", or does the elitist attitude annoy most people here too? The way I see it, while it's true a lot of pop punk might serve a different purpose and doesn't always share the same 'ethos' as old-school punk, is there really anything wrong with enjoying the music for what it is?

Can anyone of you please help me? I really dig this kind of music but I just can‚Äôt find more songs I like. Is there perhaps a subgenre that Leningrad Skyline can be attributed to, that would help me search? Or are there other similar artists? Thanks in advance"

I‚Äôm serious, I‚Äôm giving you one last chance to leave and not listen to a controversial opinion. This isn‚Äôt a vent for the faint of heart, let‚Äôs just say that. 



Ok, here goes... 
Honestly it feels like these days punk has become what it claims to fight against. They scorn censorship and societal ideals, yet they rail against anybody who doesn‚Äôt think exactly like them. How can you claim to fight against oppression when you‚Äôre oppressing your own people?? If you‚Äôre not a leftist (conservatives??? In MY punk community?? It‚Äôs more likely than you think!) then everybody is trying to disown you and shake you off like someone would with a booger and they‚Äôre screaming ‚ÄúEWWW CONSERVATIVE COOTIES GET IT OFF GET IT OFF!!!!‚Äù 
When in reality I‚Äôm every bit as punk as anybody else! Just because I‚Äôm not voting for the same person as you doesn‚Äôt mean anything. We still have the same mindset. We still have the same taste in music and fashion, and we still both detest mainstream orthodoxy. We still question authority and are independent fighters. We still want to fight for what‚Äôs morally right, and we won‚Äôt let anybody intimidate us into silence and submission. We both believe in aggressively being ourselves even if other people don‚Äôt like it, and not changing for other people or to fit in or whatever. And we both hate Nazi ideology, too!! Conservative punks and your typical liberal punks- they‚Äôre really the same at the end of the day. 
But yet... I‚Äôm constantly told that I‚Äôm not really punk. I get called all kinds of names and shamed. ... People trying to shame me into silence and submission, where have I heard that before...? It‚Äôs just really hypocritical that they rebel against censorship and hivemind mentality yet they do it themselves in their own community, picking and choosing who‚Äôs ‚Äúreally punk‚Äù and who‚Äôs ‚Äúa poser‚Äù. 
I guess what I‚Äôm saying is... I really need some friends, at least a portion of the punk community that‚Äôll welcome me and accept me, rather than rejecting me and stomping me into the ground. I really want to be loved and belong, not be forced to fight for my place in a group that claims to be against the cliquey, exclusive nature of the mainstream popular stuff. 
Go on ahead and delete this, I‚Äôm sure that this post will quickly become a hot target, but at least I can say I tried. At least hopefully one person will understand me. Hopefully I‚Äôve made some kind of sense."

3592,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Hi everyone! My name is Emma, and I‚Äôm a fourth-year sociology student at St. Thomas University in New Brunswick, Canada, writing my undergraduate thesis on female pop punk fans. I‚Äôm looking for 5-7 participants to respond to some questions about their experience as female fans of the genre.

Important information and format: My research is about younger female fans of the genre, so I‚Äôd prefer participants who are between 16 to 25 years old. However, you do not have to publicly share your age to be involved. All data will be collected, transcribed, and analyzed by me for my thesis as well as being shared with my thesis advisors and committee. However, after the deadline for the end of study passes, I will remove this post. 

In order to stay within my university‚Äôs ethics guidelines, your responses can‚Äôt be publicly posted on Reddit. Therefore, if you want to participate, please send me a PM and I will send you the questions. There are 14 questions, some of which are just general demographic information and most of which are about your experience as fans of this genre, what you like about this music, what draws you to it, etc. However, you don‚Äôt have to answer every single question if you don‚Äôt want to or you feel your answers are getting repetitive or something. You don‚Äôt have to answer them immediately, but because I have a deadline for when I have to complete my thesis, I would prefer if you answered them within a week so that I can get started on writing (however, I understand that stuff comes up and if you need more time that‚Äôs totally fine).

You can withdraw at any time by sending me a message saying that you want to withdraw. As well, if you change your mind about participating and want to have your data withdrawn from my study after you have completed the questions, please PM me before March 1st, 2020, as that is when I am aiming to have the first draft of my thesis completed. After April 1st, 2020, I cannot remove data from the thesis as it will be published by that point.

The purpose of the thesis is to study why female fans enjoy this genre of music, so I don‚Äôt anticipate any serious topics coming up in the discussion questions, however, if you feel uncomfortable with the questions being asked or if serious topics come up and you do not want to continue discussing them, feel free to withdraw.  The benefits of participating in this study are that you‚Äôll have the ability to contribute to sociological research (and help me graduate!) and have your say about your opinions on this genre of music, why you like it, and your experiences!

What will happen to your answers: The data obtained from your answers will be transcribed, analyzed, and published in my completed thesis in April 2020. I will also be presenting my research as a research fair in March 2020. There will be no identifying information, and there is no obligation to share your name, age, hometown, or anything that could identify you, and I will never at any point have access to any of that kind of information. If you are interested in reading the completed thesis and seeing my conclusions, feel free to ask me. I‚Äôll gladly send you a copy when it‚Äôs finished!

If you‚Äôre interested, please PM me and I‚Äôll send you the questions! If you have any questions about anything I said in this post, feel free to comment directly on this post (it‚Äôs only the actual questions and your responses that can‚Äôt be made public according to the ethics guidelines) however you can also send a PM with your questions. Thanks everyone!"

562,punk,punk,"A few months ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/g7aq4z/riot_grrrl_class_for_kids/) about a class on the Riot Grrrl scene I created for teens.  I got a great response from this community and have really enjoyed teaching the class (shout out to the few of you here who joined!).  

I wanted to let everyone know about a new class I just posted called [Combat Rock: Punk Rock and the Cold War](https://outschool.com/classes/combat-rock-punk-rock-and-the-cold-war-WRpHM2NZ#usS9usZPyx).  This is a two day class focusing on subversive punk on both sides of the Iron Curtain.  Day One will focus on the Western/capitalist world.  Through The Clash, Dead Kennedys, and Nena (yes, I know not traditionally punk but punk adjacent) we'll look at the nuclear arms race, US intervention in communist nations, and calls for peace.  Day Two will go behind the Iron Curtain to look at the punk scenes in the communist world.  We'll listen to Schleim Keim, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, and Tilt to learn about the Berlin Wall, Perestroika, and the eventual fall of communism.  

The class is taught via a platform called Outschool.  It's listed for students 13-18 years old, but I can happily accept students slightly younger (sorry not older) who are interested.  

You can get a $20 credit to Outschool by using the course link I posted above or [click here](https://outschool.com/2020-school-closures-offer#usS9usZPyx) to get the class for free (if funding is still available).

I‚Äôm 21 and am now undergoing a musical breakthrough. I‚Äôd always been somewhat divisive over the genre, especially in my younger years when I was primarily listening to thrash metal and rock but as I‚Äôve grown, my music taste has expanded.

Mom did a damn good job of keeping my angst from taking over my fashion and isolating me from my friends for a while after they pulled me out of high school like shit parents. Ran away from home a bit to do some couch surfing, but never really had the stability to save up money to do the fun stuff or dress nice. Everyone I hung around was punk, scene, or former scene though. Moved back in, got in some fights to set some boundaries, and lastly, most the fucks I could give about their shit is gone, just like their own youth and their strength to suppress my expression. Now I‚Äôm working up a job to get an electric guitar, some music lessons, update my fashion and get some tattoos to cover up my self-harm scars. I‚Äôd really love to *produce* music, but as far as anything scene goes, I‚Äôve barely started straightening my hair last year.

A band had to bring their practice setup and another band took 30 minutes to set up and then played like 45 so my 2 friends band one touring band from Cincinnati called Settle your Scores and other was just a popular local C-rex had to cut their set in half neither band took the show seriously after that so SYS ended up covering the Pok√©mon theme song and during C-Rex we all took the bass players mic and just passed it around the crowd. Ended up being an iconic night we still talk about 5 years later

July 12, 2020 - After a 9 year hiatus, the pop-punk/hardcore group ‚ÄãLate Nite Wars‚Äã are reuniting to record their next studio recording. The band will be tracking 5 new songs with the original lineup for the first time since recording ‚ÄúEvery Other Saturday‚Äù (Arrest Records 2009)
The idea of recording together again began brewing in December of 2018, after a 10 year anniversary reunion show. The following summer, the group began assembling the pieces of what will become their 5th studio recording. In February 2020, shortly after beginning work
with Ryan Stack (‚ÄãFormat Audio‚Äã), the process was halted due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The band is now in the final stages of the recording and plan to announce a release date later this year."

We have been running a book club for rock albums for 4 months, where we take 3 rock related albums a week (1 voted on by users, 1 chosen at random from user submissions, and 1 chosen by a member of staff) and we listen/discuss/rate them as a group. We only review rock but we all have additional interests and there is more and more cross over work being done. We are in week 17 now and have around 70 members currently. This week we are doing only monthly new album week (theme 2016 to now) with artists Benjamin Booker, Good Tiger, and David Bowie. In the past have reviewed albums from Soundgarden, Jethro Tull, Kaleo, Mastodon, and Green Day to name a few. We have members from all over the world of varied ages, sexes, beliefs and backgrounds. We don't all like the same rock but even those who are more picky have found new music to enjoy. We talk about the weirdest metal to the most light of pop rock songs.
If this sounds like something you would enjoy, we welcome you to follow this link. Just read and agree to the rules when you join then enjoy. https://discord.gg/UZbySAd"

657,punk,punk,"So I was watching the video for Stacey's mom recently and I had a bit of a revelation. Pop punk is like strangely sexist and problematic in ways that regular punk isn't.

As a trans woman, the punk scene has been so accepting and welcoming. There have been several subgenres of punk that are literally about empowering women, POC and other minorities. So it's a bit jarring when pop punk songs are mostly about objectifying women

There are so many songs by pop punk bands that are just about objectifying women. As I stated previously, the video for the song Stacy's mom is super problematic. The video depicts a 12-14 year old boy oggling at a grown woman. Not only is this sexist and objectifying to women, but it also normalizes a predatory relationship between a adult woman and a young boy.

That song isn't an isolated incident of sexism. there are so many bands and songs that promote the idea of the ""nice guy"". Descendants, Blink 182, and Fall Out Boy have all had songs portraying this type of person. 

I don't want to be like the cringe SJW type. But I find it weird how a genre that came out of a scene with bands like Bikini Kill could be so inherently sexist."

According to Wikipedia, Sunset Towns are ‚Äúall-white municipalities or neighborhoods in the United States that practiced a form of segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation, and violence. Entire sundown counties[1] and sundown suburbs were also created by the same process. The term came from signs posted that ""colored people"" had to leave town by sundown.[2] The practice was not restricted to the southern states, as ""(a)t least until the early 1960s...northern states could be nearly as inhospitable to black travelers as states like Alabama or Georgia.""[3]


Does Sunset Town also mean something else or...? Not accusing them of being intentionally racially insensitive. Just something I noticed."

Hi Guys!

I am SO FREAKIN STOKED to finally be able to announce I am the Official Spotify Playlist Curator for Bad Monday Apparel. 

I was asked to put together a playlist of Alt/Rock music blended together with a hip-hop vibe, which was fun! I've obviously included my favourite up and coming artists too 

I'll be updating the playlist with absolute bops every month to keep ya ears fresh.  


Let me know what you think! - [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/06E5LoqxjSMDMdnPrloEW4?si=kHeyK3k5Sqy304BjE9pZeA](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/06E5LoqxjSMDMdnPrloEW4?si=kHeyK3k5Sqy304BjE9pZeA)

Unfortunately instead of the Government just listening to the First Nations say no after a asking the first time, they decided to undermine them by writing ""Bill 1"", a new law that will let them kick the First Nations off their property (including schools and houses) and use it to build the pipeline or whatever else they want.

I thought I would give everyone the chance to listen to a fuckin awesome local band in the Seattle area, Neutralboy! . They've been around for 28 years and still makin great punk rock music. They try to tour through out the states as much as they can when all 3 band mates schedules are flexible enough, so you may already know who they are if you're into the local underground punk rock scene.
(Especially if you're in Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota and Utah areas).
So, click the links, sit back, relax and enjoy listening to a great underground local Seattle area band.

Lead singer Mike's solo 'Evil Fucker' music is also online now.

Neutralboy!'s next show is Tuesday the 17th of March at O'Malley's Irish pud 2403 6th ave in Tacoma, Wa.
Their shows are a blast and so are the dudes in the band.

They will also be going on a small tour this April in Colorado.

 I have some older sounding pop punk (think Green Day) songs and one that kinda reminds me of The Starting Line that I would love to have vocalists of the community be a part of. 

If you want to hear previous work to kind of reference how the project has worked in the past, I can link you the tunes. 

Hope to hear from you all and we can work together!"

865,punk,punk,"Hi, r/punk! First post here. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the type of content that y‚Äôall like, but I figured it was an important story to share amongst us punks. 

I met my roommate at a DIY punk venue called The Hole when we were in high school, around eleven years ago. The entrance to the venue was literally a 3 ft. tall door in an alleyway. It was sick!! But it was ultimately closed down bc of fire regulations. 

On Sunday night, my roommate was arrested for breaking curfew... he was literally dropping off bail money at the bonds office. He had made two previous trips (BOTH after curfew) and was told that he was lawfully breaking curfew and could come back as many times as he wished. In between visits, he was inside at a friend‚Äôs apartment near the jail. The third visit, he was arrested. 

It was such a surreal experience to drop off bail money for him across the street from the very venue where we met. Not something I‚Äôll soon forget. 

He has since been released, unharmed. However, he know has an FBI file. Talk about punk cred!! 

But in all seriousness, please stay safe punks. Support one another and amplify the POC voices of your community. Stick together. Fuck the police."

So I take a new job October of last year, my office mate is my age shares my politics and all is good. One day he's printing something and I comment on the fact that the printer is louder than the Reagan Youth I'm listening to and he says Reagan Youth...that leads to a conversation about skating, punk, as well as kids and wives.

868,punk,punk,"Hey guys, I'm working on a youtube channel that to help educate people about punk music and culture and I was originally going to make my first video about post-hardcore but, I felt like I ought to post-pone that video's production as it was a bit too light in tone to be released during these recent events. With that in mind, I want to do my part in raising awareness for these protests and to do that I have decided to shift my focus onto making a video about punk's political history as well as showcase bands both new and old that have not only released songs about protest but have protested themselves.  

Feel free to post any band across the genre that you think fits the bill, especially if they demonstrated for human rights. Feel free to share bands from your local scene as well. If they have any lyrics available for me to read through and possibly quote that's even better.

1754,punk,punk,"I am currently in college for film production. One of my professors has worked as a camera operator and director of photography for about thirty years. Throughout his life, he traveled across the country filming for various employers and he has spend a fair amount of class telling us a lot of stories. One of them involved the band Broken Bones. I do not know exactly when this took place, but I am assuming that it was around the turn of the decade based on what I know about my professor's life.

Basically, Broken Bones were playing a punk festival/event in California. I am pretty sure it was inside a warehouse. It was one of those shows where the band and audience are on the same floor without much separation. As you can imagine, the crowd was going wild, so wild in fact that the cops showed up and tried to break up the festival. My professor did not know why they were there. Unfortunately for the cops, trying to break up a crowd of punks is quite difficult and the two sides broke out fighting. It got to the point where the cops started throwing tear gas into the crowd, causing even more chaos and motivating people to get out of the building. Eventually, it got to the point where there was a fog of tear gas in the building and my professor has to take his camera and leave. While he was doing all that, however, Broken Bones were still playing. I don't recall him ever saying that the say them stop. He had caught the entire show and fight on video, but he was stopped by an officer and had to hand the footage over because he did not have the location release form, therefore had shot the event illegally. I like to imagine that there is a DVD containing that entire show sitting in a vault in some California police station, but in all likelihood it was disposed of.

IDK how interesting this is, but I thought is worth sharing."

Gee the money‚Äôs really great!

I guess 1984 was a different time, and we have to keep things in historical perspective.

2163,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Edit: oops typo

I've been going through a nostalgia trip of Neck Deep videos for the past hour or so and felt inspired to make this post. Coming from someone who discovered the band between A History of Bad Decisions and Wishful Thinking, I naturally sometimes find myself missing that original sound that hooked me on the band. One thing that I was instantly hit with is the realization that Rain in July is... not very good in retrospect lol. The nostalgia is there but man those tracks are nothing compared to the amazing songs they went on to write. I honestly think that no matter what they do with their sound, they consistently write better and better songs with each era. Watching them grow has been a treat. I know a lot of people aren't finding enjoyment out of the new singles, and to be honest I was taken back by the direction at first too. But as I commented on another post earlier, once I accepted that this is their direction I was able to find the enjoyment in it and I love all the songs they've put out so far (especially I Revolve and Sick Joke). Just wanted to express some love and share my excitement. If Life's Not Out to Get You was Neck Deep's Enema of the State, then All Distortions Are Intentional could potentially be their Untitled (remember people didn't like that album at first either)."

2361,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Bring out the Dickies Shorts, spike up your hair, and find your favorite home in Enema of the State, for I‚Äôm delving into the golden era of pop punk!
Everyone already knows it. With breakout-to-mainstream-in-no-time bands like Blink 182 and Enema of the State in ‚Äò98 cementing itself in music history, and Drive Thru‚Äôs New Found Glory, who don‚Äôt even need an introduction to their influence (considering two influential pop punk bands named theirs after song lyrics or titles by NFG), the genre personified arrested development in youth and harnessed the fear of the unknown with reminiscent but hopeful chords and melodies that we can relate to and find a home in almost instantly, even if you‚Äôve grown up in that era and you‚Äôre in your 30s now. The culture around this genre was palpable and spanned the planet for a time, but by nature, an onslaught of fantastic bands just couldn‚Äôt gain the traction of their influences/peers. 
I think my favorite example is another Drive Thru special named The Starting Line, specifically their debut ‚ÄúSay It Like You Mean It.‚Äù The band started as a good old ‚Äúvocalist wanted‚Äù ad in a record store in ‚Äò98 and the rest was history after Kenny Vasoli came to play. A year after their debut EP was released they instantly were scooped up by Drive Thru and SILYMI was released just over a year later.
But it just didn‚Äôt take off. It never even reached Gold certification. Their breakout single ‚ÄúThe Best of Me‚Äù was a regular sight on MTV‚Äôs massively popular Music channel for a time but just didn‚Äôt have the fanfare of Blink, NFG, Simple Plan, and Sum 41, and although a fantastic tune, it‚Äôs, in my opinion, one of the worst representations of the rest of the music on this album.
While it can likely be attributed simply to a naturally-oversaturated genre, loads of unique personality and massive, massive dedication is required to get there and stay there. 
And that‚Äôs a shame because SILYMI is a top 10 album of mine that outshines so many other albums in this era in every way.
Jam packed with clever, reminiscent, heartfelt lyrics and genuinely positive content, juxtaposed against slamming guitar intros, riffs, and instrumentals that aren‚Äôt afraid to experiment or take their time delivering atmosphere, they also toss in touches of hardcore influence and screams in songs like ‚ÄúA Goodnight‚Äôs Sleep,‚Äù ‚ÄúCheek to Cheek.‚Äù They used a well-known blueprint, taking plenty of influences from Blink and Green Day, but what resulted was less of a surface-level, summertime pop punk banger album and a more somber, emotionally-aware derivative that wasn‚Äôt afraid to lay in on emotion and their influences from the emo and post-hardcore genres. If you‚Äôre a fan of pop punk/emo, take the time to listen to this album. Whether it‚Äôs their hopelessly hopeful ‚ÄúUp and Go,‚Äù their searing ‚ÄúCheek to Cheek‚Äù (wait until 0:40 if the song isn‚Äôt your cup of tea), or their obnoxiously catchy ‚ÄúDecisions, Decisions‚Äù that features cowbell... I think you‚Äôll all find something to love here. 
Let me know what you think, and what else is super underrated from this era do you think?"

I don‚Äôt think that our favorite bands need to be broke or anything, but the resurrected Misfits was/is a blatant money making enterprise to the point where the music itself was an afterthought - a somehow less talented KISS."

3233,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I've seen a lot of comments about how new Neck Deep songs aren't as good as LNOTGY or about how TPATP isn't as good and doesn't live up to it etc. But I don't think Neck Deep is trying to sound anything like LNOTGY because if you look at that album from an unbiased standpoint it's one of the absolute best generic pop punk albums ever written. They caught lightning in a bottle with that album. IMO it is up there with early Blink and Green Day albums that defined the genre. If Neck Deep tried to write songs and albums to replicate LNOTGY every comment would instead be ""this is good but LNOTGY is still better"". So stop comparing everything they put out to something that most likely will never on be replicated."

Looking back then, those songs were only 7 years old....that doesn‚Äôt seem very long now knowing *Sticks and Stones* came out 18 years ago...

It just bothers the fuck out of me when  somebody State something like they are some Punk Rock God , that was at every punk rock show and lived thought every country every city and every year of punk rock and just cause you read it does not mean you where their living it.

This is whenever I talk to someone about a certain album's sales and compare them to other albums. I just feel that this can't really be true at all or to an extent. If they say they don't care about how much their albums sold or how many streams it got, it gives me the idea that they don't care if they make money, which is completely absurd. They have to care about numbers at some point, otherwise they might get the idea that they can do whatever they want and it will be considered a masterpiece. If they actually paid attention to numbers, then, if they're low, they should take it as a way to see what could have led to that situation and see what they can do differently in the future."

""you're perfect, perfectly clean"" and ""you're a normie"" can be referencing the sober people around them. Plus in the music video, the couple is definitely tripping balls.

Additionally, the thing that resonated the most was one verse where a friend of the person singing dropped off his dog/pet, said he was going on vacation. The singer asked if he could come and the friend said it‚Äôs not that kind of trip and end up going to kill himself.

Overall, the song is pretty sad but it‚Äôs not slow paced. Please help me if you can lol

 I've been listening to some rapsongs by lil darkie and his boys &amp; some random songs on soundcloud. The underground rap scene is getting heavily influenced with punk elements.

 I've been enjoying the influence in their songs and on the underground rap scene.

So as a newbie in this genre ( I know a couple songs of minor threat, black flag, leftover crack been really enjoying the lyrics of leftover.) Wtf should I listen to to understand the roots of the genre aka the OG's.

949,punk,punk,"But hear me out.  


I know that in the mid-90's, and especially in America, punk (as I came to know it) was hugely popular. NOFX, Rancid, all that sort of shit kind of hit the mainstream and skate-punk was the one thing every teen and their dog was listening to. 

But the thing is, we also had the other genres going on too. We had psychobilly, hardcore, street punk, bands that didn't really fit the mainstream but your average skate / pop punk listener would eventually discover. So we got stuff like Swingin' Utters, Dwarves, Snuff, Osker, Son of Sam and all that. Good mix of hard loud music.  


All that shit is DEAD now. 

And it's weird because it's not like there was this huge fucking gap between the 70's and 90's where punk rock disappeared. We still got All, Adicts, Descendents, GOB, Adolescents, Guerilla Biscuits. Punk never died.

Coming back to the genre now (after years of losing interest), those styles of music are fucking obliterated. You'd think the internet would make them easier to find, but nowadays 'Punk' has such a broad meaning that any Spotify playlists claiming to be 'Punk' seem to be full of whiny, acoustic shit or bizarre electronica. Not saying they can't be punk, but all those genres I used to love with the fast thrashy chords and aggressive vocals and 2-minute song lengths are gone. 

Is that it? Is all that good stuff gone or do I just not know where to look anymore? Fat Wreck kind of keeps it alive but their new bands ain't too hot, and all the stuff keeping that scene alive is old bands who have just been in the game for decades."
938,poppunkers,punk,Looking for a new csgo discord and I hoping I could join one that is populated by my fellow punks. Glad to join anyone's server as long there's activity and you don't mind that I'm new and still learning
305,punk,punk,"Tired of people being judgey based on what i wear to concerts. Yeah, i forgot my battle vest and came straight from work. Does that make me less punk than the people who worked hard on their spikes? I'm tired of going into punk rock venues and given the evil eye because i dont fit it. And the people who dress up for shows are more often than not, fucking posers who act holier than thou, yet treat me like I'm not ""real punk"".

Punk is how you feel, how you act; not what you wear."
2052,poppunkers,poppunkers,These are my two favorite pop punk bands and I don‚Äôt want to have to like one song over the other but that‚Äôs just how it will be naturally.

1648,punk,punk,"that surf rock - syd barretty - punk guitar driven stuff. preferably with jello biafra - mark hamill‚Äôs joker esque vocals. 

already know the rest of DK‚Äôs stuff and some dick dale, y‚Äôall got anything else like that? *insert save chappelle crack meme*"
2701,poppunkers,poppunkers,Might have to listen to again but Boston Manors new album did absolutely nothing for me if I‚Äôm honest. Most of it just blended together and and I didn‚Äôt even realise most of the songs had finished before it was halfway through the next
556,punk,punk,"I admire the Kubans really much, gimme some soft or hard shit!"
2602,poppunkers,poppunkers,"This might be a longshot but a few years back (I guess after the first 20/20 comp came out but before the second one) there was a blog that had made an unofficial vol. 2. I remember being really into it but for the life of me can't seem to remember the blog (I'm really just trying to compare it to the official version to figure out why I liked it more, maybe it was just the track order), but does anyone know what I'm talking about?"
1954,poppunkers,poppunkers,"ive been in the pop-punk community since 7th grade. since that time, ive discovered a lot of pop-punk bands that don't get as much attention as they should. if you're looking to check out some of those bands and freshen up your playlist, here they are:

‚Ä¢ Between You and Me: they're a pop-punk/emo band from Australia and all of the songs ive heard by them are bangers. i recommend their songs Overthinking, World in Grey, and Cut Me Some Slack.

‚Ä¢ AS IT IS: they're possibly the best British pop-punk band ive ever listened to, mainly for their raw and honest lyrics, and their unique sound. i recommend their songs Soap, Drowning Deep In Doubt, and Bitter Broken Me.

‚Ä¢ Makeout: they have a lot of cheesy songs, but they're still fun and energetic nonetheless. i recommend their songs Lisa, Till We're Gone, and Childish.

‚Ä¢ Trash Boat: they're one of the few punk rock bands left in the modern era, and all of the songs ive heard from them have so much energy and rawness to them. i recommend their songs Eleven, Don't Open Your Eyes, and Catharsis.

‚Ä¢ Tonight Alive: if you throughout that Paramore was the only good pop-punk band with a female lead, you thought wrong. Tonight Alive are an AMAZING Australian pop-punk band with an amazing female lead, Jenna McDougall. i recommend their songs Wasting Away, Come Home, and The Edge.

‚Ä¢ Story Untold: the best Canadian pop-punk band that's here to make up for Simple Plan's mistakes. i recommend their songs Mental Breakdown, Dreams That We Don't Share, and California.

that's all the ones i got! happy listening! &lt;3"
2018,poppunkers,poppunkers,i was kinda hoping that there's the album artwork without the ND logo and album title in it? and at least 1080p or 4k reso. thanks!
577,poppunkers,punk,Am i? Or am i overthinking?
1524,punk,punk,"So I‚Äôve only recently gotten into punk music simply because I found out the origins of punk are in political protest and I‚Äôve become obsessed. I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of music but most of it is kind of old and I‚Äôm looking for some bands that are more current because now all I want to do is go to a concert. (Obviously after Corona but still) 

If you know of any bands that I should listen to or places to find more music left me know :)"

994,punk,punk,"Evenin' folks,

This album right here, Inflammable Material by the Northern Irish band Stiff Little Fingers was the album that really *forced* me to realise that they (and the people inspiring them) were really living through something, that they felt they *had* to take a stand and that [the gnarly sound that came out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKsN5cj9ehs) was there to reflect the current state of affairs.  
Before Inflammable Material was lovingly plonked in front of me I'd been listening to a lot of 70s punk but I was so young at the time that I was only repeating things like 'punk meant something' rather than having really connected with the lyrics and the energy of the recordings on my own terms to make my own mind up.

[This album from '79 serves as a reminder for me how music across all genres can really have a message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nx8adlkvFw) and that integrity and honesty are what really carry a tune at the end of the day.

**What was the album or song (by any artist of any era) where you really got hit by the message punk music was carrying?**  
I always love hearing about people's connections to the music they love so some stories and listening suggestions would be a great discussion for us to kick into!

695,punk,punk,"I'm in a new punk band, and we're really struggling to find a good name. Do any of you have any ideas/ inspiration? Any answers would be greatly appreciated!

Info about the band if that helps: we're a very political band. We're anarchocommunist and very anti-fascist. We have one trans member (me) so we will probably have some songs centered around transphobia. Our songs will mostly be in English, but we're from Norway.

Sorry if this isn't quite what this subreddit is about, I don't really know where to go."

2334,poppunkers,poppunkers,One of my pet peeves is when too many singles are released before the album drops. For example stand Atlantic announced their album coming out in August and 5 out of 11 songs are already out! Am I the only one who gets annoyed by this or do people like more singles than waiting for the whole thing? I personally would rather have 1-3 before an album drops so that it's a cohesive experience when I hear it and I'm not tired of the songs already.

31,poppunkers,punk,"I am searching for a song that I sadly cannot remember the lyrics to so I can't search it up.

It is by a girl or girl band and it is a hype song from the I'm thinking 90s or 2000s. It was in movie soundtrack in the back of a chase scene (I was thinking Scooby-Doo but I've gone through all of the movie soundtracks and I can't find it) but was definitely popular in movie soundtracks.

It is reminiscent of ""get the party started"" by pink but a bit more hype/upbeat."
478,punk,punk,"What exactly was minor threat's stance on anti corporationalism? How did they for example acquire instruments without breaking their own rules? And would it be hypocrytical of me or anyone to purchase a shirt from them, or a counterfeit one? Why did they allow specifically urban outfitters to sell a 28$ minor threat shirt? These are just some questions I've wondered about as I've started to research and learn more about that band and the scene in general, happy to hear some thoughts and discussions! :)"

2901,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I personally would give the honor to All Time Low.  My reasoning being that they made fantastic albums after some less-than-stellar albums on major labels. The first being Don't Panic after Dirty Work (though that album still has some gems) then their most recent album Wake Up, Sunshine after the failed experiment known as Last Young Renegade (though, again, that still has some gems). But that's just my opinion."

A close friend of mine just passed and ive been trying to get someone to draw a maggot getting his wings as he evolves to the next life.  Ill pay its no issue but it would mean alot to me and our whole group if I could get it done. You can guess what we called him.  We would go to every show and rage without a care in the world ill miss you man. 

I tried the other subs but they wouldnt get the style im looking for thanks if you can dm with price."
1116,punk,punk,"Ok so, as far as punks go, I am especially weird. The thing is, i have an extreme phobia of crowds.  So i Always only have 2 options: stand in the back (most manageable) stand in the front (least manageable, also I don't want to be an asshole to the people who waited for hours) The weird thing is, i've never gotten drunk because my entire body is extremely sensitive to alcohol (I start coughing and choking if I drink a small sip of red wine) 

But last summer, I had an amazing experience. Me and a friend of mine attended a Foo Fighters show (I know it's not necessarily that much of a punk band, but I need to get this point across) and we were standing right in the middle of the crowd. That summer, i was unhealthily skinny (I was at the brink of an eating disorder) and I almost fainted several times before. The show started, and I slowly started getting dizzy, and I could feel the blood leaving my face As the crowd closed in on me. But right next to us, i saw a mosh pit starting to open. And I knew: if I don't start moving, I will faint and miss out on one of the Best concerts of my life. So i grabbed my friend by the wrist and literally told him: ‚ÄûIf anything goes wrong, toss me on top of the crowd"" and I jumped, with my skinny, underfed ass straight into the mosh pit. 

And... I didn't faint. I made it through. And that was when I realised: Punk isn't about politics. Not About mohawks, not about leather jackets. Not even about the alcohol or the drugs that I never had. Punk is that little voice in your head, that screams ‚ÄûFuck It!"". As far as i was concerned, I could've fallen to the ground and got stomped. But as Dave Grohl was screaming ‚ÄûAll my life"", i decided that I don't care. That for once in my life, i won't give a shit about myself and just become one with that euphoric feeling of ‚ÄûFuck everything"" 

Since then, I changed As a person. I became more certain. Less insecure. Beforehand, I was an anxious little derp who never knew what he wanted. All it took was that one phrase.

‚ÄûIf anything goes wrong, toss me...""
That is the Essence of punk."

Favorite band of the 00s?

Favorite band of the 10s?"
2492,poppunkers,poppunkers,"So a few days ago, I saw an article that was about crafting the ultimate album, based on the original track numbers of the albums they were released on. IE, ‚ÄúWelcome to the Jungle‚Äù was Track 1 on ‚ÄúAppetite for Destruction‚Äù, is their choice for Track 1 on the Ultimate Album.

I can‚Äôt find the article now, but it got me thinking about the success of the March Madness brackets here, and what my ultimate album might look like.

It took me most of the day yesterday going through my iTunes and narrowing it down. It was a lot of fun, but also very difficult. I‚Äôll post the winner of each track, plus a few runners-up, and then you can use your imagination about some of the songs I had to leave on the cutting room floor.

Some notes about methodology ‚Äì I tried to stick with original songs off of their original albums. No compilations, greatest hits, or covers (unless they‚Äôre just that good/well-known). My tastes lean heavily into the mid-90‚Äôs to 2010, so most of the songs are from that era and don‚Äôt include a lot of the newer bands. A number of the songs bleed into other genres. I am 100% confident that I overthought this, and will continue to overthink it.

To state the obvious: These are personal choices, and this is in no way, shape, or form an objective ‚Äúbest album of all time‚Äù. I welcome feedback and questions about my choices, but hope that conversation remains civil (I have no reason to believe otherwise, but sometimes things need to be said). I also wholeheartedly encourage everybody to contribute their own albums.

I‚Äôm going to do a countdown with a little commentary starting from the last track, but the TL:DR album is at the bottom.

Hope you enjoy!

Track 14: I originally figured I‚Äôd do about 12 songs, or however many I could get with a reasonable number of choices. Managed to get here.

Runners-up (alphabetical order because Excel):

A Day To Remember ‚Äì ‚ÄúLeave all the Lights On‚Äù

New Found Glory ‚Äì ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù

Fall Out Boy ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got all this Ringing in My Ears and None on my Fingers‚Äù

You Me at Six ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Rumour‚Äù

Winner: Green Day ‚Äì ‚ÄúWalking Contradiction‚Äù

Tough but not that tough. Not a ton of options, and the longevity takes it here.

Track 13:

A New Found Glory ‚Äì ‚ÄúNo News is Good News‚Äù

A New Found Glory ‚Äì ‚ÄúBoulders‚Äù

A Skylit Drive ‚Äì ‚ÄúSee You Around‚Äù

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Story So Far‚Äù

Silverstein ‚Äì ‚ÄúRain Will Fall‚Äù

Yellowcard ‚Äì ‚ÄúCut Me, Mick‚Äù

Winner:

Simple Plan ‚Äì ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù

This was surprisingly difficult for the tail end of the album. I guess the adage ‚Äúsave the best for last‚Äù applies here. Starting to notice a theme ‚Äì I freaking love NFG.

Track 11:

Runners-up:

Bayside ‚Äì ‚ÄúGuardrail‚Äù

Emery ‚Äì ‚ÄúEdge of the World‚Äù

Fall Out Boy ‚Äì ‚ÄúBang the Doldrums‚Äù

Hawthorne Heights ‚Äì ‚ÄúSpeeding Up the Octaves‚Äù

Rise Against ‚Äì ‚ÄúSavior‚Äù

Winner:

Silverstein ‚Äì ‚ÄúCall it Karma‚Äù

One of my favorite all time songs, it wasn‚Äôt that hard to pick the winner. Good selection of runners-up, though. Had to leave some good ones off the list.

Track 10:

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory ‚Äì ‚ÄúHeartless at Best‚Äù

Coheed and Cambria ‚Äì ‚ÄúA Favor House Atlantic‚Äù

Fall Out Boy ‚Äì ‚ÄúI Slept with Someone in Fall Out Boy and All I Got Was This Stupid Song‚Äù

Silverstein ‚Äì ‚ÄúLove With Caution‚Äù

Winner(s):

Green Day ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhen I Come Around‚Äù

Thrice ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Artist In The Ambulance‚Äù

Had trouble choosing and copped out. If I had to choose one, I‚Äôd probably go with Thrice and bump PATD or Coheed off the list. 

Track 9:

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory ‚Äì ‚ÄúPersistent‚Äù 

Brand New ‚Äì ‚ÄúGuernica‚Äù 

Less Than Jake ‚Äì ‚ÄúMostly Memories‚Äù

Winner:

Rise Against ‚Äì ‚ÄúAudience of One‚Äù

Another one of my favorite all time songs, with some tough second place finishers and brutal cuts before that. ADTR, Blink 182, Bayside, and The Almost just to name a few.

Story Of The Year ‚Äì ‚ÄúNothing Can Fly‚Äù

Winner:

Silverstein ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy Heroine‚Äù

I almost put Green Day as a co-winner again, but that seemed disingenuous. More tough cuts to get to this list. More NFG, Blink, FOB, Bayside, and Thrice.

Track 6:

Runners-up:

All Time Low ‚Äì ‚ÄúDear Maria, Count Me In‚Äù

Bayside ‚Äì ‚ÄúChoice Hops and Bottled Self Esteem‚Äù

Rise Against ‚Äì ‚ÄúPrayer of the Refugee‚Äù

Silverstein ‚Äì ‚ÄúStill Dreaming‚Äù

Winner:

No contest on the winner for me. ADTR, Something Corporate, Underoath, and Yellowcard among the cuts.

Track 5:

Honorable Mention: Avenged Sevenfold ‚Äì ‚ÄúGunslinger‚Äù ‚Äì not really Pop-Punk, Emo, or Post-Hardcore, but it‚Äôs a great song.

My Chemical Romance ‚Äì ‚ÄúWelcome to the Black Parade‚Äù

Thrice ‚Äì ‚ÄúStare at the Sun‚Äù

Winner:

Brand New ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows‚Äù

WTF. I continued to cut as I‚Äôm writing this post, and I still have that many left. Some of those are top 20 all time songs. I had to leave ‚ÄúCalling All Cars‚Äù (Senses Fail) and ‚ÄúSouthern Weather‚Äù (The Almost) off. TWO FOB songs (‚ÄúHum Hallelujah‚Äù and ‚ÄúNobody Puts Baby in the Corner‚Äù). Wow.

Track 4:

This is getting tough.

Yellowcard ‚Äì ‚ÄúOcean Avenue‚Äù

Winner:

Coheed and Cambria ‚Äì ‚ÄúWelcome Home‚Äù

Hard choice here. Ultimately had to go with the epic feel of it, but I‚Äôm not solid on it. Any of these could do the job. So many songs cut here.

Track 2:

The Used ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Taste of Ink‚Äù

Winner:

A Day to Remember ‚Äì ‚ÄúAll I Want‚Äù

I categorically refuse to make any last minute cuts here. I can‚Äôt. So many good options. Any of these could sub in, depending on where I wanted the album to go. I suppose that holds true for any of top picks.

Track 1:

A New Found Glory ‚Äì ‚ÄúSelfless‚Äù

A New Found Glory ‚Äì ‚ÄúRight Where We Left Off‚Äù

Basically, at the moment I am completely obsessed with Alkaline Trio. I grew up on hardcore punk and as I got older, started to find most of it somewhat cringey and hard to listen to. I don‚Äôt mean to offend anybody here as I can see how most of the stuff posted here is enjoyable for a lot of people, but a lot of it comes off as cringey to me as well but in a different way. 

Anyways, back to Alkaline. I don‚Äôt know what exactly draws me to their music so hard, but I can‚Äôt stop listening to them. I love the witty lyrics, dark themes, and Skiba‚Äôs (clear/un-modified?) voice. You know how in a lot of pop punk they seem to have a singing style that seems sort of forced? Like an accent? That puts me off to a lot of pop punk that otherwise would appeal to me strongly.

I know it‚Äôs kind of a lot to ask for but can anybody recommend me some pop-ish, melodic, punk that isn‚Äôt so dramatic with the singing style? Thanks for reading and I look forward to listening to what you throw my way!"

Lee Ving didn't even get to say 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4 before all the punkers had already swarmed the stage and knocked the microphone down. The audience was both shocked and pissed since those rich guys at the front could hardly even see what was going on. Ian gets a hold of the mic and yells ""New Yorks dumb!"" and they were cut off immediately. Lee Ving was called the next day and told that he and his band had caused 30.000 dollars worth of damage to which Lee responds ""That's a patent lie. We did 150.000 dollars worth of damage. We fucking counted it ourselves!"" and he slammed the phone down."

It is by a girl or girl band and it is a hype song from the I'm thinking 90s or 2000s. It was in movie soundtrack in the back of a chase scene (I was thinking Scooby-Doo but I've gone through all of the movie soundtracks and I can't find it) but was definitely popular in movie soundtracks. 

It is reminiscent of ""get the party started"" by pink but a bit more hype/upbeat."

I recorded the song to a cassette from TV around the mid-2000's. I wrote ""Popcorn"" on the cassette label, but I don't know if this is the name of the band or the song. The band looked young, late-teens or early-20s. It was a music video that I found randomly while going through the music section of my cable provider's ""on demand"" service. The video didn't look high budget, but it didn't look like it was shot with someone's camcorder either. So, professionally shot, but limited budget. I've tried Shazamming it and googling lyrics, as well as searching for bands and songs called ""Popcorn"". I've already posted to several subs as well as Yahoo Answers and a few other places, without luck. I'll leave the vocaroo link here (the audio quality is bad, but it's all I've got):

1765,punk,punk,"Some friends and I are in the brainstorming phase of a project she's putting together. It's a multimedia performance project scheduled for Halloween revolving around murder ballads. She asked if my band would want to help out with music, and it seems pretty cool so we're in.

Prepping for a meeting we're having, I'm trying to think of punk rock murder ballads. Wikipedia references a bunch of folk tunes and then songs like Goodbye Earl, El Paso, Mack the Knife, a couple of Bob Dylan tunes...

So the question is, can r/punk suggest some? It should be a song that tells a story about a gruesome killing or death. The only one I've really been able to come up with is This Could Be Love by Alkaline Trio. What do you guys have?"
1763,punk,punk,"The ""100+"" and a few other punk movie posts I've seen on here either don't mention a few true classics ... or they're buried in uncombed comments. The biggest offense? Omitting the first...

* Suburbia (1984)

And:

* Straight to Hell

* Dudes (... someone mentioned it in a comment, but it's easy to miss)

* Liquid Sky


Also, this is gonna be contentious, but I think Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead is pretty punk. 

Following are some contenders because of presence of punks, and/or they're movies punks like ... well, we liked them:

* Afterhours

* Bedazzled (1967)

* Brazil

* Decoder


Honorable mentions:

* Suddenly Seeking Susan 
* 1984"

I actually studied Music Production at uni, but unfortunately never managed to make it into the industry after graduating in 2010, bills needed paying so I got into a boring 9-5 and I've not really done any production since. I'm incredibly rusty but thought I'd share anyway. 

All this is recorded with free software, plugins and guitar amp/cab sims and the tracks are listed in the order they were recorded, hopefully showing improvement in my playing and production. Hopefully this 30-something can still hang playing pop-punk

To cure selective deafness in the global elite

LBJ didn‚Äôt fight the vietcong

And Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt know poverty

Has he ever had to choose between two of his needs?

Now that it poses a threat to *his* life 

Now that it‚Äôs affecting *his* kids and *his* wife

May the motherfucker finally reap what he‚Äôs sewn 

May he ache and hurt in the depths of his bones

May he feel the pain of being a statistic

It's just a music video. A very artsy video too, I should say.""

675,punk,punk,a question i have is if i would still be considered if i dont dress the part? i listen to pubk music and i hold punk music but dressing punk doesnt feel like me. so im just wondering if i would still be considered punk.
3768,poppunkers,poppunkers," So I have a cool story i thought id share !  


&gt;*In 2017 I got free tickets to my second blink-182 concert ,the first one i went to my ex made us leave 4 songs into blink 182 and it was the worst experience of my life we were so far back! So the second one I got there a few hours early. I remember hearing them sound check and looking through a crack to see them and saying ""look how close they are!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*So.... Being in the first 20 people in i was right in front of Mark and about half-way through Blinks set Mark said ""theres a guy we met in the meet and greet earlier who's bragging he could play all our songs"" where you at? come up here and play"" ... So instantly I hated the guy , he looked like something out of waynes world and he was playing with my favorite Band... well to everyones astonishment he gave the guitar back to Matt Skiba and looked embarressed said ""i cant play"" dove into the crowd and vanished ... I told my then new but now ex-girlfriend ""watch this"" and started trying to get marks attention. well I did and he asked what song i wanted to play so of course i said Adams Song and he said noooo so i said stay together for the kids and they hadnt played it ...SO I did mess up in the begining but i did perfect after we restarted! even somehow improvising a solo with a pick slide!! The best things in life are free!!!! all thanks to Tom Delonge quitting the band! i feel like the only one who is thankful for that!!*

SO Since that day I have worked super hard to put my own sound together with a heavy blink influence ..... yesterday someone who doesn't even know me who heard my first single ( it came out yesterday) said it reminds him of ""the old blink-182"" which is literally the biggest compliment I could ever hope to get! So I figured i'd share it with all of the blink fans out there!!"
3122,poppunkers,poppunkers,Has anyone heard of sugarcult and would they be pop punk
662,punk,punk,So my band recently found out there is an artist that has the same name as us and has been around longer. So we need a new name. I came up with the name Vicious Society and was wondering if that was a good one. If you have any ideas please comment them!
91,punk,punk,So prettt much I want to expand my horizons. My musical knowledge stops at like 1959 and the only music I really know besides that is a few rock n roll songs and meme songs. Is punk a political party or something or is it just music?
705,punk,punk,"Been listening a lot to Conquest For Death, can someone recommend me simillar stuff? I'm not a fan of their other albums tho. I also like Void a lot, Neggative Approach and all the other hardcore bands that were signed to Touch &amp; Go"

1876,punk,punk,"Musical brethren, this is a long shot and I joined reddit just so I could make this post üòÇ I‚Äôve recently been thinking of a punk cover of Cascada‚Äôs ‚ÄòEverytime We Touch‚Äô. I used to have an MP3 of it, among other songs, but I cannot for the life of me remember what the band was or any of their other songs - but in my teenage years I loved ‚Äòem.

Think Victory Records style bands. I don‚Äôt know if they were ever signed to VR but perhaps that‚Äôs how I came across them.

I‚Äôm keen to revisit the songs but google is unfruitful. I estimate this would have been in the 00s, maybe 2008-2011.

I guess you need to A) know super obscure bands that likely don‚Äôt exist any more and B) know about punk covers of pop songs ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Any ideas people?"

Any guesses?"
568,punk,punk,"The song starts off counting 1-2-3-4 and the recurring part before the chorus he sings ""SUMMERTIME"". Halfway through the song they stop and do another count, its a different riff.

1.

JJ Bedsore (The Blood) - The amount of piss he sunk and was still able to play as well as he did. His solos aren‚Äôt just ‚Äòlook at me I‚Äôm shredding‚Äô, they‚Äôre melodic and fit each song. It‚Äôs a fuckin hard thing to do when you has a blood/alcohol level of 0.2 whilst recording. 

2.

Johnny Ramone (Ramones) - 99.9% of people are born with bones in their arms and wrists. Not Johnny.... he had a rubber fist. It‚Äôs crazy to think the likes of ‚Äòloco live‚Äô or ‚Äòwere outta here‚Äô are recorded with just 1 break. The amount of stamina and wrist energy it takes to play that shit isn‚Äôt human. 

I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions. I know I only said ‚Äòfavourite‚Äô, but this is punk. Fuck the title, post your best"

I don‚Äôt know much about how venues work cos if I‚Äôm honest I haven‚Äôt ever been to a gig before but I‚Äôm pretty sure it will be the venue making it adults only so is there any point asking the band if they could risk getting us in if we lifted some equipment for them or should I just leave it and see if they‚Äôre still a band when I‚Äôm 18.

It‚Äôs so boring because everything here caters to 3 types of people- old people, frat boys/sorority girls, and country boys/girls- and that‚Äôs made this stupid town basically punk repellent. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing here unless you like bar hopping with frat boys, country music and hunting, football, ugly kitschy stuff with rhinestone crosses and ‚ÄúSouthern girl‚Äù all over them, or getting flower print old lady dresses and overpriced furniture at antique stores.

So recently some protections were removed or they're going to be removed (I read two articles on this and it's unclear) that protects the LGBTQ community from being discriminated against by doctors

Now from what I've read this mostly affects trans and non binary people. However there's a very interesting way we can all resist this bigoted bullshit.

When signing your intake form at the doctor's office when the gender question comes up instead of putting f or m ""accidentally"" put non-binary or ""trans"" 

Now you might be asking ""what would this accomplish?"" Well if we got a ton of people on board with this then bigoted doctors and doctors offices can't refuse trans or nonbinary people as it would cut into their profit margins.

Since many of us are locked in our homes, it's time to start exploring new artists! I'd love it if you checked out some of the pop-punk projects I've been working on. Musically, it's heavily influenced by classic pop-punk like blink-182 and Green Day. Lyrically it's closer to the Wonder Years. There are some modern pop influences in there as well. I listen to a lot of Post Malone, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish.

208,punk,punk,"Ok, so I'm having trouble remembering an album from I feel the late 90's to mid 2000's. I know I listened to them in high school. I've googled all the bands I thought sounded like them. I've tried finding like bands. I can't come up with it.

So it was a band that I'm somewhat sure was in the post-hardcore, punk scene of the early 2000's. To describe them, I'd say a lot like Every Time I Die, really fast and constant drums, the vocals were also very uh, yell-y. Not screaming and high but very much yelling. Also no throat-y screaming. But constant drums and really fast like Every Time I Die, but with a more thrash metal style.

The album I listened to a lot I believe was a relatively boring cover, a lot of grey. Also, for sure, the last song had a guest singer. I really really want to think it was In Flames, with that almost fake high-ish growl/scream. I'm sorry I don't know how to describe that style of singing. I tried searching every In Flames song to find this and couldn't, so I may be wrong about who it was. But it was very much that style.

So.... anyone have an idea?"

1715,punk,punk,"I think he is, he was/is an alcoholic for almost 100% of his life, like piss drunk all the time and did an insane amount of drugs right. But he was still wrote absolutely beautiful songs that were historically significant, profound, had multiple meanings. Musicians would come to his place and they would pull out pieces of paper from heaps of garbage and they would still be genius. Not to mention he invented a genre and the music was absolutely electric

He never sold out at all or changed his beliefs despite the band being contentious over them and kicking him out (only to bring him back). Personally even when he was a human wreck he never gave a fuck about what anybody thought of him, he had no teeth or recently he would be on TV or a concert in a wheelchair drooling and barely managing to sing. But despite of all of that he is loved by the masses and succeeded as a guy who identified with street beggars

[https://youtu.be/wnUuyzAcj\_c](https://youtu.be/wnUuyzAcj_c)  


This is a request for some honest feedback \[yes, I really do mean honest\] Don't worry about being 'mean'  


I present a radio show ‚Äì where during the lockdown I‚Äôve taken on a project to write and record two new songs a week. In all different genres. We are doing 20 songs... so far have done 18 of them.

  
The singer is excellent. This song was a punk song. A genre I love.

  
The singer \[who spent two years in the West End playing a lead in Les Mis, and has done many other shows and high-end singing jobs\] found this the hardest song to do

  
It less than two mins

  
If you have the time, it would be amazing to get some honest feedback. As it was a struggle to record.   


I and the singer have read out \[on my radio show and a followup video\] the best comments for this song. By best I mean all the interesting ones - so maybe I should have said the worst comments \[hmm\]. And so are very happy for brutal comments.  


As well as on my show - this song was also put onto a punk radio stations playlist. But although I love the genre, I  am under no illusions that we are anything but daytrippers.  


The song is about someone believing all the fake news, and going out and acting on it...

  
Feel free to write any reviews/comments,  \[don't worry about leaving 'bad' comments\]. I will respond to them all.    


I wrote the words, music, video. The singer did the melody and singing. Comment on anything - how authentic is sounds, the song, the mix/mastering, the singer, etc..  


We are doing another punk song at the moment... but that is NOT part of our 20 lockdown songs.

  
You can comment here ‚Äì or better still on the videos YouTube page.

  
Thanks for the help

The film follows the story of Raven, a failed Broadway actress turned amateur adult film star who attempts to leave the industry and move back home. However, her family believe she made it big in America, forcing her to live a lie.

Raven uses music to escape her dark reality as she tries to start her life anew, getting a new job and entering into a new same sex relationship; however the adult film industry has taken its toll, leaving her paranoid and mentally, physically and emotionally vulnerable.

3589,poppunkers,poppunkers,"When I was a freshman in college, my friend's brother-in-law was involved with booking bands at a venue in our city. He hooked us up with free tickets to the Nintendo Fusion Tour show, but even better was getting us into the after party.

We had wristbands to go upstairs at some dive bar to the after party. I was a huge fan of Fall Out Boy, Panic! and The Starting Line at this time, so it was fun to hang out with some of the guys.

Some of my memories:

- Kenny Vasoli (lead singer of The Starting Line) was hammered (as was I). This was back in 2005 and I had just got my first cell phone, and had also just started experimenting with alcohol. So whenever I got drunk, I would ask almost anyone I was having a conversation with at the bar for their phone number.

Anyway, I asked Ken for his phone number and he gave it to me. ""Only you can drunk dial me,"" he said. Every now and then I would drunk dial him from that point forward.

- I noticed one of the guys from Panic! getting drunk by himself at the end of the bar. Everyone else at the party was having a good time except for him. I tried talking to him and cheering him up but he was having none of it. Turns out this guy was their bassist who would be fired from the band soon after the tour.

- Pete Wentz was wearing something that looked like a white mink coat, and I was shocked to see how short he was.

I was also a huge Motion City Soundtrack, but none of those guys were at the party, even though they performed that night.

Anyway, I always thought this was a cool story but I never had anyone to share it with. I thought you guys might appreciate it. It was cool to hang out with some of the guys from Panic! and TSL while they were at their peak, and see Pete before FOB became ridiculously huge."

So, feel free to shamelessly promote your band in this thread. Additionally, I am making a spotify playlist of whatever people post or send. So post in here and you will most likely be added to the playlist!

We have been running a book club for rock albums for 4 months, where we take 3 rock related albums a week (1 voted on by users, 1 chosen at random from user submissions, and 1 chosen by a member of staff) and we listen/discuss/rate them as a group. We only review rock but we all have additional interests and there is more and more cross over work being done. We are in week 17 now and have around 70 members currently. This week we are doing only monthly new album week (theme 2016 to now) with artists Benjamin Booker, Good Tiger, and David Bowie. In the past have reviewed albums from Soundgarden, Jethro Tull, Kaleo, Mastodon, and Green Day to name a few. We have members from all over the world of varied ages, sexes, beliefs and backgrounds. We don't all like the same rock but even those who are more picky have found new music to enjoy. We talk about the weirdest metal to the most light of pop rock songs.

Just discovered them (from this subreddit) today, curious what artists have the same sound and feel? Their music is difficult to locate but found 3 albums on bandcamp, and some youtube uploads (where Behind Enemy Lines also was linked).

We all have said at one point that we wished a specific band would get more love. But then you have all of these smaller guys saying the same thing and getting much less. I'm guess I'm saying that I wish all of us bothered to  give some of the lesser known ones a chance more than we do.

Do you consider Television to be 'punk'?

 Joined by the lead singer of Britpop favourites ‚ÄòDodgy‚Äô; the legend that is Nigel Clark.

‚ÄòNige‚Äô blasts off stories about forming the cheeky 3-piece, the joy of being a part of the whole Britpop movement and passing up a support slot for Oasis at their legendary concerts at Knebworth in 1996 ‚Äì a decision which the band don‚Äôt regret at all and their reasons for doing it are worthy of a standing ovation.

Nige requests us to tuck into the debut album by American Rock band ‚ÄòTelevision‚Äô entitled ‚ÄòMarquee Moon‚Äô which was released in 1977.

TD and WG were up bright and early for this one whilst Nige was kind enough to keep podding until 1am UK time.

A legend and a bloody marvellous chap at that.

I write a small fanzine dedicated to worldwide Punk/Hardcore (The Swingkid Fanzine). For my next issue I'm looking for some help :) - and maybe you want help me.

I live in germany and am always asking myself how much people outside germany know about german Punkbands - and how they react on them, especially, when they are singing in german.

So: Here is a list of 7 videos from german Punkbands. If you are interested: Listen to these bands and look at their videos - and tell me what you think - in one word, one sentence, however! Please do not react to them all at once, but for each one individually (the bands don't belong to each other...and for sure you skip, if you don't want to listen to them). And if you want: Please write down from which country you are.

I don't know, if this work, but I want to try it :) - Thank you!

2050,poppunkers,poppunkers,"This is a real niche question, but as someone that likes considering the placement of songs on an album...if you were a band releasing a CD (let's say 10-14 tracks), where would you slot in the lead single?

I can see arguments for a few different spots: Track 1 kicks off the album with something familiar, but I also think having it tucked in as the third spot gives you something to build to, plus if that fourth track is strong people will probably just keep on listening and that might become a favorite.

Anyway, probably pretty dumb, but hopefully someone else has geeked out over stuff like this, too."
3582,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I sold one of my basses to a kid tonight, and we got to talking about music. I realized that a specific song changed my life. Holiday by Green Day was the reason I picked up the bass when I was twelve years old. That solo showed me how cool the instrument really was and it was the best thing I ever did. I've played in dozens of bands in dozens of cities, and even got to tour with a Grammy nominated artist, and it's all thanks to Holiday. So I'm curious, what song had the biggest impact on your life?"

A prescient,  very musically competent and wonderfully fucking ballsy and influential favorite band I will always love. One of the highlights of any show I have ever seen was watching lead singer Dave do naked cartwheels across the stage.  Keep in mind this was an open air show circa 1985 in cow town Santa Rosa, Sonoma county. Much later the drummers 14 year old son played an incredible solo as well. An overall legend status punk band who always walked it as they talked it.

I'm surprised people tolerated it given that Punk's mostly a youth based subculture or at least was. I understand that some states have laws meaning that liquor can't be served if the venue allows people under the age of 21 in. However it is still  bulshit as you can still serve beer. When I start releasing music and such even though it's not punk I'm not going to tolerate this.

The song was about a band's early days. I remember lines about sleeping in a van but not much else. However, after the song, there is about 3-4 minutes of the band telling stories. One of the stories involved the van breaking down.

I was really hoping the song would appear again on one of my Daily Mixes but it hasn't. I would have saved it while it was on but I didn't have my phone on me and ended up forgetting and not remembering until it was too late."

In the early years of the scene, we had bands like PXNDX, Allison, Divisi√≥n Min√∫scula, and much more. The biggest one of the bunch was PXNDX but they broke up years ago. 

I'd say the biggest pop punk band in M√©xico at the moment is Say Ocean. They are like a mix of State Champs and Real Friends.

3694,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Microwave is an four-piece Alternative Rock outfit hailing from Atlanta, Georgia. While there blues rock sound isn't what most people would consider ""Pop-Punk"", their heartfelt lyrics and scorching, power chord driven songs cement them as a quintessential band of today's ever-changing Pop-Punk landscape. The heart and soul of this band lies with their frontman, Nathan Hardy. Nate brings an unparalleled one-two punch to the equation with his playfully poetic lyrics and unreal guitar prowess. His voice is unlike any other. Slipping effortlessly from high screams to a delicate falsetto, then dancing down to a monsterous growl. 

I'll be the first to say that I'm not a huge fan of their latest release. It's seemingly lacking the charm that previous efforts brought to the table. With that being said, Stovall and Much Love are both marvels of modern rock. You all owe it to yourselves to give these two records a listen.

So my band.. isnt a band? It's just me, my guitar and bass, my shitty vocals and a BUNCH of drum loops. I literally run everything off garageband. The reason for this is that no one in my area (a small town in Tennessee) enjoys punk music, or even rock in general. So I just kinda set out on my own.

So my ""band"", Starbomber. I wanted to take classic punk riffs and add pop lyrics over it. And you may think ""but isnt that pop-punk?"". Yes.. kinda. I dont like the ""new"" pop-punk (2010 onwards), so I wanted to make something more in line with classic pop-punk (Buzzcocks, The Undertones, The Jam, etc.).

1161,punk,punk,"Or go pirate music on Youtube.

This pandemic is going to be the final nail in the coffin of most of the independent record stores, and a lot of the labels and distributors that was putting vinyl into those stores.

But it isnt the pandemic that's to blame. You are to blame.

Because you support silicon valley companies like Bandcamp. Because you get your punk music from Google (aka Youtube). Because you have done this for years, instead of supporting that cool punk record store down the street, or ordering vinyl from Interpunk.

Your decisions caused this. YOU. 

Some of us put our lives into this thing, and you just sat there behind your iPhone(tm) making cute remarks while some of us mortgaged our homes to try to keep an independent alternative alive.

By the end of this year, there may be no more record stores left. And the ones that are left may not have any distributors to buy from. 

Do you like vinyl? Well enjoy paying $40 for reissue vinyl off Amazon, since you were too lazy to pay $10 for a new punk record at your local record store.

But you won't notice, will you? You'll just keep giving Apple 99 cents to load a song onto your super punk $500 smartphone(tm), or being really edgy and giving it to Bandcamp instead.

THAT is your scene. 
THAT is who you are. 
Because YOUR ACTIONS show us who you really are.

So keep it up! Enjoy this new world you have made! Because this is you.

(You fucking hashtag, corporate-dick-sucking, lame ass poseurs who think you are rebels; you can go fuck yourselves.)

Goodbye"

I wasn't joking since I (regretfully) continue to read some wiki... and gosh, she is pretty hardcore. I would also be pretty mad if some highranked celeb underpaid me and stole my work

What are you punks thoughts about Solanas? A crazy person or a visionarie? Nonetheless it's interesting culture history."

More time passed and I started looking for contact info.  I only found an email on their facebook.  I emailed them a few weeks ago asking for an update and never received an answer.   I did again friday and still no answer. 

I want that shirt and don't want to cancel my order.  Has anyone ordered from them before?  Or does anyone have any advice?  I have 90 days from the order before paypal won't let me cancel it.

Again with covid I'm understanding that it's late.  I just want to make sure I still get it.

It doesn‚Äôt have to strictly be pop punk bands either. Hardcore, emo, and post hardcore bands are also doing it and I‚Äôm sure most of us are into that too. 

Thoughts?"
258,punk,punk,This may be a dumb questions but I‚Äôve been thinking about this recently. Sometimes politics confuse me.
542,punk,punk,"Anyone with an understanding of music theory knows Steve Jones and Glen Madlock, the guitarist and bassist, composed all the music of the Sex Pistols.  Some even had lyrics.  At first Steve Jones was the singer, later hiring John Lydon to sing. Similar to Steve‚Äôs incompetence leading to something interesting, John‚Äôs lack of skill as a singer led to ‚Äúanti-singing‚Äù and was very influential.  That to me is the extent of his legacy.  Right place at the right time, had a creative approach to singing.  

His touch of political lyrics while different was hardly the first; John Lennon a few years before wrote a lot of music with politically conscious lyrics.  IMO Lydon lifted that from Lennon. ‚ÄúNevermind the Bollocks‚Äù was completed instrumentally, and all John did was sing over completes tracks. ‚ÄúSilly Thing‚Äù, one of the best Sex Pistols songs, was done without John, which proves my point.

Since then he‚Äôs suffered from narcissism, egomania, and a slave to how the media wants him to be. In his recent interviews and autobiographies he thinks so highly of himself and proceeds to criticize and rip on everyone.  Holier than thou. Literally claims he Single handedly invented punk music as well as the fashion! Claims Malcolm got all of his ideas from him.  He hardly has a positive review for any of his contemporaries and denies being influenced by anyone. He claims he ‚Äúrevolutionized music twice‚Äù with his second band PIL. That more than anything is utterly untrue.  Iggy Pop made a post-punk album ‚ÄúThe Idiot‚Äù years before PIL.

Musicians in the music industry know this. Hardly anyone can stand him, which is why the Sex Pistols don‚Äôt perform anymore.  He‚Äôs been able to trick everyone else, picking up accolades , giving countless interviews, and allowing journalists and layman to attribute so much to him.

Johnny ‚ÄúRotten‚Äù.  He is a liar, fraud, conceited, narcissistic, cruel, arrogant, hypocritical, and pretentious.  I can go on and on with more adjectives and just ripping him to pieces.  

The reason for this posts is besides his own band members like Steve Jones putting him down, I see nothing but praise and reverence for this overrated fraud."

3795,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I've been really into Foxing recently, and reflecting on the album Nearer My God got me thinking about *why* I like it. I began realizing it had a few similarities with other albums I liked quite a bit, even though stylistically it isn't terribly similar. I've sort of narrowed what I think the similarities are down to the followong:

'Wall of noise' - heavy use of white noise, feedback, and other random noises that all seem to fit the song, and takes up significant amounts of the ending mix. Important/repeated melodies will pan in and out of the wall and chaos frequently. Lo-fi sounding recording used frequently. See: Grand Paradise, Pull, Limousine, Vices

Layered vocals - used much like an instrument to add to the wall of noise. At times pretty well hidden within the mix. Often distorted, naturally and via effects. 
See: Leather Daddy, Luca, At the Bottom, Five Cups

Incredible dynamics - All of these albums will have you constantly messing with your volume knob, but to just sit and enjoy the volume shifts, stacking sounds, or lack there of is phenomenal on all of these.
See: Sowing Season, Won't Drown, Noro, Hate TKO

Relatively cryptic lyrics, often having religious undertones.

These bands all also seem to have 'cult followings' leading me to believe other people actively seek out these qualities too.

Mike Sapone has used these elements in other bands he's worked with like Taking Back Sunday, and Sorority Noise, so I've been wondering if it really did originate with him and Brand New, or if maybe there was someone earlier, or other people making similar music? 

Anybody have any insight into the origins of the sound, or similar acts to recommend?"

2113,poppunkers,poppunkers,"@@@skip to point 3 if you just wanna get to the meat of it@@@

Hey guys. So for starters, wow. It‚Äôs been forever since I‚Äôve been on this subreddit. Literally years. So I was heavily in the scene back in what I consider the ‚Äúglory days‚Äù, circa 2012-2016. My high school years, pretty much. And as a large majority of us do, we move on to other genres when we near our twenties. Due to changing tastes in both the music scene, and yourself. Whatever. But some time down the road we all come back to revisit a couple albums that we deemed to be the best back in our days. For me it was Copacetic. And it‚Äôs absolutely mind blowing to revisit this album again. So here‚Äôs a couple points/observations that I‚Äôve gathered over the past few months of me listening to it daily once again. 

1) this is the best goddamn album ever. It was my top album of all time back then, left that slot when I moved away from the genre, and it‚Äôs back on top. For good this time. 

2) the absolute musical intricacy these guys have is insane. And this specific album really highlights that. Specifically how heavily their entire style relies on the drummer. As a POP PUNK BAND. That‚Äôs unheard of. 

3) my biggest point of all, and a long one. I remember when this album first came out, one of the primary talking points on this subreddit was how the lyricism never really made any sense. Like Joe just couldn‚Äôt really string together a story right. Now that I‚Äôm revisiting this album, just the way this guy can paint pictures, wow. His lyrics are nothing short of perfect for what he‚Äôs trying to portray. And I think that one of the biggest reasons we thought this back then was because our high school brains (and ik all of your asses were in high school too) just couldn‚Äôt comprehend the sheer calibre of stress that adult life, and specifically adjusting to it, can bring. And this whole album is about coming to maturity and the overwhelming scale of pain you‚Äôre about to endure while you adjust to it. You‚Äôre literally lost for a bit while you figure it out. Take it from a guy that‚Äôs nearing 23 and FINALLY got out of the scare years of adulthood, from the ages of 19-22 you‚Äôll question what you‚Äôre doing with your life daily, and have existential crisis‚Äôs daily. I don‚Äôt care who you are, it‚Äôs gonna happen. To every single one of us. Our stressors in high school consisted of girl problems, and girl problems. Which is probably why we had such a hard time appreciating Joes lyrics. ‚ÄúGive them what they want to see, a kid lost in his twenties‚Äù is just so unbelievably real that I literally ‚Äúfelt the rush of blood beneath my skin‚Äù after hearing that lyric for the first time in years. To be cheesy. 

Either way, it was just a really mind opening experience to listen to Copacetic again after all these years. I haven‚Äôt connected to an album like this ever until I picked it up again. I find a lot of comfort in it, and it has tremendously helped me just stabilize my mind in adulthood, and has helped me accept that shits gonna suck and always will suck. Cause that‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs what you make of it that counts. And if you‚Äôre going through that early adulthood crisis, listen to Copacetic again. I hope it‚Äôll bring you comfort like it brought me."

Further probing uncovered someone totally unexposed to punk music at even the highest level. I turned my shock and disbelief into many wasted hours making about a dozen different playlists going from punk 101 intro to punk through an exploration of many different sub genres and finishing with modern punk theory. 

It was a fun exercise and got me wondering what everyone else would put a playlist for someone who‚Äôs lived under a rock to give them a digestible entry into the world of punk?

But I was a black kid in a suburb and going through shit and idk but the descendants just hit something fierce. It wasn't until college that I got more. I guess all this back story is to say that when I'm at one of these protests and we're all saying George Floyd and Breonna Taylor's name, it warms me up to see you guys out there. It's scary.. everyone I know out there is on edge. But you guys coming out in support, chanting with us, rallying with me? Means a lot

1053,punk,punk,"I totally understand wanting to fit in &amp; look cool and listen to all the right bands. I wasted a lot of time and energy when I was 14 or 15 trying to do exactly that.

 But if fitting in and looking cool and listening to all the right bands is everything you want out of this community then you're at best selling yourself short and at worst posing harder than you can imagine. This is a culture that you participate in &amp; learn about just like any other. It's not like there's a punk rulebook that the rest of us can just recite back to you. If you really feel like it's necessary do some reading about the history surrounding this scene but honestly it's probably better to get your taste from whatever's popular in your local underground. 

Someone in another thread made what I feel like is a very important point- don't put punk on some pedestal that other genres and subcultures can't measure up to ever. Punk is extremely nebulously defined (&amp; in a lot of ways lacks definition) and it's absolutely possible to behave in ways that are ""unpunk"" by most people's definitions- and that's okay. This isn't for everyone. We aren't some cool cultural elite. I'm some dork who likes it when the drums go fast &amp; the cops get things thrown at them. That's cool to me but maybe not to another person- &amp; I'm not any cooler than anyone else. If you listen to more soft singer-songwriter indie pop than anything else &amp; were thinking about voting for elizabeth warren, that's fine, you are a valid &amp; probably wonderful human being, just don't be surprised when someone wearing a spikey jacket does a double take when you call yourself punk. That isn't a reflection of what punk is empirically as much as it is what most people who participate in punk agree that it is. 

It's so incredibly hard to describe the diversity of possible experience in what we call ""punk""- it isn't as narrow as a lot of people make it out to be. But it isn't something you can strive to be so much as you just are in attitude &amp; action. Speaking as a mod here, this sub is barely a facsimile of what punk truly is &amp; it could never measure up to the real thing. (When it's safe and advisable) go outside &amp; find where the shows near you are. Try and make some friends and experience this yourself, instead of being that goober trying to impress aggressively online reddit punx. You don't need to look like a perfect crustlord at the first gig you ever go to or even the second or the third or ever.  This isn't an aesthetic to adopt and front on social media, it's something you participate within and contribute to. It is a lived experience not an image. Go live it."

I feel really bad for the venue staff though..."
1035,punk,punk,"So ive listen to punk for a few years but was never really interested in ""punk fashion"" until recently.

One of the things ive started seeing a lot is these boots that everyone calls nazi stompers. So i tryed to look what they were in terms of history but i didnt find anything. 

So can someone explain the history behind them if there even is one?"

I want to be punk but I don't want people to be jumping on me if I go to a concert."
429,punk,punk,"Today I found out that Mr Chi Pig, the singer for local punk band SNFU passed away on Friday. He was a absolute legend, knew how to put on a crazy show and I won‚Äôt ever forget him. Head Smashed in Buffalo Jump is still one of my favourite songs. RIP Chi Pigüíî"
1721,punk,punk,I found this very interesting punk band called Destructo disc. In 2019 they released this single called breakfast in space and I feel that this band deserves more recognition so I am trying to spread them through word of mouth
1137,punk,punk,"So back story in a city person, originally from NY, moved to this secludes town MD a few years ago and have hated it, there's no scene here, don't have many friends that listen to the same music, and I have to drive 2 hours to go to any shows. But luckily I plan on moving next summer and I'm currently looking at places and I want to go to a place with a good punk music scene. Currently considering Philadelphia and Chicago but I wanted to know if there were any other you guys would reccommend.

Overall I'm really into anything punk, pop punk, ska, emo, metalcore

I've heard good things about Seattle but I'm not sure"
2352,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Finding Spotify increasingly frustrating for finding new alternative music that is on the fringes of my current spheres. Always end up going round on circles.

So, anyone have any good podcast or playlist recommendations that cover maybe some new tracks or artists, open to some discussion about the music if a podcast but main focus should be the songs. Also doesn't have to be strictly pop punk."
956,punk,punk,"I'm trying to write music, and I was wondering what people personally think makes a good punk song. I think that personally a good intro and emotion in the voice/lyrics are the most important factors to me. Lyrical, musical, or just anything related, what do you think makes a good punk song, I'd rlly love to know!"
2365,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I decided to go check his Twitter to see what he has said about BLM because of how much of a [bigot he is](https://twitter.com/shaant_h/status/859931832749633538?s=21). But he seems to have fallen off social media about 3 months after that tweet. 

Unless he made new accounts?"
3549,poppunkers,poppunkers,"Im new to this genre but recently heard and instantly loved this song. I don't listen to a whole lot of different people. I listen to a few people all the time. I have listened to about half of the No Closer To Heaven album and every song has been okay but this song is AMAZING. any suggestions for songs similar to this or should I keep listening to the wonder years? Are most of there songs like this? Or does anyone have song suggestions of similar songs to this, by TWY or other artists?"
425,punk,punk,I recently got ACL surgery and was wondering if anybody here had acl surgery and how long do I have to wait till I can return to something I fucking love doing.
677,punk,punk,"Last night a friend I really look up to came to me and we talked about some burdens in life  


I was surprised to imagine that he, which I really looked up to as someone I could learn with, had some burdens that I knew how to deal with  


I can't call myself a punk, but I have always listened to punk music, tought about punk ideals and learned through them, and I noticed I'm really thankful for all I learned with this community and this culture. Even though I'm not a punk, I'm who I am because of punk  


And this is a sincere thank you"
50,punk,punk,"Can you guys recommend some songs that also deal with paranoia and ""everyone being against you""? Thanks!"
887,punk,punk,"i'm sick of it. here's the story. i \[F16\] was making a song abt ACAB and BLM, because of the current events. my parents bust in and tell me to stop this non sense, and that i am just as bad as the rioters and looters out there (they did not allow me to protest). they tell me that the ""genre"" i was emulating was for the non educated and unsuccessful dirty people. after trying to tell them my side, they fucking hit me and took my guitar and phone. i'm done. the punk community has taught me more abt the world and issues than anything had, and i will never fucking stop. i just wish they knew that. idk how i can take action anymore, they took everything away. :("

725,punk,punk,"So this may seem stupid but, I love punk. The culture and the music and the beliefs are truly awesome. I have a Mohawk but because of the school I'm going to (medical, and if I want to do clinicals) I have to cut my hair. Does this make me any less punk? Especially cause except for my backpack (which I have covered in pins and patches) I dont partically dress punk."
1985,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I just really wanna start a pop punk / emo project but I've not had much luck finding people. I've been avoiding just coming here and asking because I'm not totally sure what the community and mods are cool with. The frustrating part is; this sub is the only sub where I feel like people could actually understand what I'm going for because we all listen to the same music. 

Granted, I'd understand if people didn't wanna see a 100 posts a day about ""looking for guitarist I'm a singer"" type stuff. Just doesn't seem like it's easy to reach out to the pop punk community online when it comes to finding like-minded musicians. 

If not, I'll take the L. Just thought I'd shoot my shot and see how people feel about that type of thing."

I am here because I here from two different sides one saying I'm punk one saying I'm not. The people who argue I'm not punk say I'm not because I don't regularly listen to punk music witch I don't I stopped listening regularly when I stopped self harming because for some reason there was a tie between the two. On the side that says I am says so because if I was on my own I would have a battle jacket I am a anarchist and I have full punk belief

Therefore, I figured I'd ask here: what are some names suitable for a Riot Grrrl group? Ones with themes of feminism, anarchism or both would be appreciated."
2247,poppunkers,poppunkers,"I generally an avid pop punk fan on this reddit, I've posted a few times searching for people to make music with or just to listen to new stuff from people.... well people who are like us! That's why we are all here right? :D

A handful of you guys encouraged and helped me improve when it came to recording so I wanted to revisit the song I shared here months ago, and rework with everything I learned so far. Don't expect the next ""knuckle puck"" or anything like that! lol

I'll post it in the comments below! Also don't forget!

To share your quarantine pop punk inspired tracks in the comments! I wanna hear them! :D

  
Now for my story behind this (tl:dr below):

Last I posted I was barely getting my feet in to recording music, I honestly found what worked for me with my iPad Air 2 and a Peavey VIP amp. I'm not making music to aim to be famous or anything like that, someone on a subreddit called ""sharemusic"" talked about how to make music that you yourself would want to listen to. If you can enjoy your own tracks on loop, than chances are someone else might too. With a changed mindset I started experimenting and playing around with the sound and styles I like. 

But everyone says my music sounds ""pop punk"" still (probably cause it's a huge backbone to what I like) but my gf says it reminds her of kung fu generation, or maybe something punk rock or pop rock. But she says that she can hear the pop punk influences in the tracks. I know people on here have expressed that early Kung Fu Generation has a lot of pop punk influence in their music. But...... why bring all this up? Well during that time I was searching to make music, I kept putting my mind in this box of it has to sound ""pop punk"" I had even made a song and shared it here and there were people who liked but everyone said it was missing that extra punch, but they could see potential. Then a few recorded tracks later, I wanted to revisit the song with a fresh mind and made something that made me look back on what got me here. Which was all you guys! FloodTide and JayHaze42 I know ya'll are here! Thank you!  


I want to share that song with you! Obviously it's not ""professional"" sounding. But I hope you can hear that I truly had fun making the song and with that I can close that song knowing I did right by it. Ya know?   
Also I'll post it in the comments below cause I don't want it to be view as spamming a selfish promo, that way only those interested in this post and are curious after reading it can find it below.  


TL;DR - I once posted looking for musicians to collab with to make music, I showed people my stuff and everyone here helped me find my path to recording. I learned to carry forth what I love about pop punk but also not limit myself to a ""pop punk"" only mindset. Recently I wanted to ""do right"" and go back to that song that started it all. The very song I shared here. I added new stuff played around with it and now I want to share it in the comments below. What you guys helped me make, coming from zero knowledge recording lol, like I didn't know what a BPM even was.

  
Thanks everyone!"
55,punk,punk,"It was a 4 track record with Exploited on one side and Discharge on the other (pretty sure).  Sex and Violence was one of the covers and I THINK one of the Discharge tracks was Hear Nothing.  I kept coming up with Hellhammer or Dishammer, but nothing came up for them.  I used to own this record but seemed to have lost it during moving and now I'm trying to come up with the info on it."
