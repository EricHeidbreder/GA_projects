1047,2.5078026959238082e-194,1.0,"There’s tons of styles of punk that never get love on this subreddit and people are too reluctant to accept them. every time I go on here, it’s a meme/fanart of the same classic 30 punk and 30 hardcore bands. People consistently repost NOFX/Rancid/Descendants adjacent/clones of their music and show much love and appreication for them and never other styles (Noise Punk, No Wave, Beatdown Hardcore, Screamo)
Whenever people post these genres, or anything that’s subgenre of punk or hardcore, they’ll get a couple of upvotes and like 3-5 comments at best.

Here are genres of punk/hardcore punk that I’d see never see here and I’ll discuss them

Powerviolence (Spazz, Infest, Gasp, Capitalist Casualties, Charles Bronson, The Endless Blockade, Hellnation)

An absurd hardcore punk subgenre with fastcore/thrashcore roots, taking dissonant and raw elements of the genres, and takes small elements of noise rock. It’s the most extreme style of pure hardcore punk, not fusing it with metal and it isn’t a crossover genre. It’s a noticeable characteristic to have sludge metal moments and revert right back up to intense speed and chaos. It can oftentimes be confused and hard to tell apart with grindcore, a genre I’ll get into later.

There’s barely any powerviolence posted here. There’s barely any love or attention for the genre, Not one single essential post about Powerviolence that is posted here that even has over 100 upvotes. I don’t see why this might not be posted here. Too chaotic? Too weird? A bit more gnarly then the usual Black Flag or Fear for you? I don’t know. But hey, we can post 90s pop punk/melodic hardcore with raspy singing all the time, because that NEVER gets too much attention, doesn’t it?

Fastcore (Larm, Septic Death, Siege, Deep Wound, Asocial, early D.R.I)

Essentially, a more raw sounding, faster version of regular hardcore punk with blast beats being utilized 35% of the time within this genre. Fun fact: Blast beats in extreme music was first used in THIS genre, not thrash metal, not black metal, and not death metal. Felt the need that punks here needed to know that. It’s a known predecessor to Grindcore and Powerviolence.

This is really fucking dead and SO underrapreciated here. I’ll see love for D.R.I pop up a bit, but that’s for their crossover thrash stuff. Why can’t we take notice of this style more? Without these bands, so much amazing shit wouldn’t exist. They’re important.

Screamo/Emoviolence (Orchid, Pg.99, Jeromes Dream, Saetia, City of Caterpillar, Swing Kids, Combat Wounded Veteran)

An offshoot of emotive hardcore, while the emotive hardcore/post hardcore predecessors avoided the trappings of hardcore punk, screamo bands hailed the latter’s raw, fast, and aggressive tendencies. (Credit: Now Their Love Is A Ghost on Amino). It can fuse with powerviolence sometimes, making it emoviolence.

You know this subreddit is fucked when the massively influential posterboys of this genre like Orchid and Pg.99 won’t even surpass 30 upvotes, seriously? I would say this genre is the most influential to punk than the other genres so far. Punks in this subreddit won’t acknowledge the importance of these bands but everywhere else people will, weird.

Noise Punk/Post-Punk/Post Hardcore (No Trend, Swans, Unwound,, Unsane, Sonic Youth, Big Black, Rapeman, Nation of Ulysses, Christian Death, early Today Is The Day, Bauhaus, The Birthday Party, too many too name)

Like it or not, post punk/noise punk/post hardcore is still 100% as punk as the Ramones or Dead Kennedys. It’s the same literal foundation, but they did more stuff with the genre and have much more wider influences. These guys’ influences should not be ignored considering Post Punk I’d say was insanely influential to alternative/indie rock but also metal (Celtic Frost, Metallica, and Entombed loved these type of  bands) and Steve Albini of Big Black and various other bands, is every noise punk and indie rocks dream producer.


Beatdown Hardcore (25 Ta Life, Bulldoze, Neglect, Slugfest, Cast Aside)

Beatdown Hardcore is a sub-genre of Hardcore that grew out of the New York Hardcore scene in the early '90s alongside Metalcore. There is a lot of confusion between these two genres as they are both metallic styles of Hardcore with overlapping features such as a mid-pace tempo groove, tough guy charisma, and fanbase. However, Beatdown Hardcore is strictly a Hardcore sub-genre and not a fusion genre. The main characteristic of Beatdown Hardcore is its thuggish attitude and emphasis on mid-tempo palm-muted riffs akin to Slam Death Metal that occasionally speed up into typical New York Hardcore sections. Oftentimes, the lyrics are street-influenced, focused on crew activity, representation of one's hometown, and lifestyle. (Credit: burningseasonvxse on RYM)

I’ll be fair here and say this genre is pretty much dead from what I know aside from a couple obscure bands keeping it real. But still, is it not hard to say, post a 25 Ta Life song every once in a while, get a lot of upvotes,  see some interesting comments about the beatdown genre or the band? This existed at one point in time and it was pretty important. It can’t be hard to remember the bands here. After all, isn’t this what I see in this subreddit? Over glorifying the same classic bands? I think so.

Crust Punk (Amebix, Anti-Cemix, Extreme Noise Terror, Doom, Sacrilege, Disrupt, Hellbastard)

A style of punk very similar to anarcho punk, imagine Crass or any anarcho punk but influenced by the sounds of speed metal, thrash metal, and first wave black metal.

I have a feeling that this subreddit KNOWS these bands are 100% real and 100% punk as fuck. It may be because I assume these 90s pop punk/melodic hardcore lovers don’t particularly enjoy them or have a narrow view on the genre. If I can see punk bands incorporate harmony and melodic riffs to there sound and get posted here a fuckton, I don’t see why these Crass lovers that incorporate nasty metal into their framework get posted here

Sludge Metal (Melvins, Eyehategod, Crowbar, later Black Flag, Dystopia, Iron Monkey, Buzzoven)

A doom metal and hardcore punk fusion. A hardcore punk take on say, Black Sabbath.

Man, if none of these bands are punk, neither are the songs from the b side of My War, and if you think that isn’t, holy shit, you really are reluctant huh? Melvins took huge cues from the likes of Flipper, Black Sabbath and Black Flag. Actually, King Buzzo himself said that they were taking massive influence from Flipper and Black Flag but there’s “less Black Sabbath than you’d imagine” (still ain’t denying the Sabbath influence though). Eyehategod on the other hand, said it themselves that they ripped off Black Flag. and the whole NOLA bands were called Sludgecore. People should accept these bands as punk and need to be more open minded.

Grindcore (Napalm Death, Sore Throat, Repulsion, Pig Destroyer, Nasum, Wormrot)

A fusion of hardcore punk and extreme metal. Take Fastcore/Thrash Metal and have influence from crust punk artists like Electro Hippies and Hellbastard. Napalm Death and Repulsion are cited as the originators of this genre.

It seems like some people here have a pretty poor interpretation of the genre and think stuff like “its death metal but super fast, yuck! Not PUNK”. It has a strong punk philosophy in the lyrics, attitude, song structure, and even throwing punky riffs. The vocals totally have vocals that could be 100% on a crust punk and even on a regular hardcore punk record. I mean just listen to fucking Repulsion, it could totally be on an early punk rock record. It has so much of the attitude honestly. It sounds like a mix between D.R.I and Slayer.
or Napalm Death, a mix of Celtic Frost and Siege, everyone says that. 

I was gonna list off more genres but eh, I think I’m clear. One of the other reasons I’m complaining is because it’s different from r/metal in terms of posting music. They show love for nearly every genre, bands from so many different genres that are different from each other, stuff that can range from post metal (Neurosis) to brutal death metal (Cannibal Corpse). Tons of upvotes and comments at it too. I never see shit like that here. Nothing that can range from Killing Joke to Combat Wounded Veteran. If this subreddit encompases the major appreciation for the genres and bands included, I bet it’ll probably have had just as much as users in r/metal."
1004,3.1480946584542014e-129,1.0,"After crying to Never Meant and some midwestern emo mixtapes you found on YouTube and shotgunning 19 cans of nonalcoholic vegan soy root beer for a couple of hours you check your local hardcore group page and see a post for another concert next week. It’s Solace, XRespectxYouthx, a local pop punk band called My Sunday Confessfinal (they are really out of place) and a local metalcore band called Burning Cupid. The show starts at 8 and doors at 7 so you have time to go right after work and the show ends at 11 so you can probaly have dinner after. You are friends with all the bands on Facebook even though you never really spoke to them. You check your bank account and realized you only have 30 dollars in your account but hey who needs food right. You click the I'm going option. The day comes you put on your black Harms way hoodie and X your hands, black/white vans, put your camo shorts and xibadla cap. You get on the bus. You get to the show people are outside smoking and chating. You see ton of people hugging and laughing but once the show starts they will start beating each other up and spinkicking and throwing each other off stages. Everyone either looks like someone from the 90s or the girl from recess. The venue is in a rough neighborhood so you quickly run inside. The place was a garage that was turned into a skateboard park. You pay for your ticket and awkwardly stand there looking at your phone. The show starts. The first band Solace A local melodic hardcore band comes on. The band is just a Counterparts rip off band. people push piting, 2 steping, stage diving and spin kicking. A few people were mic grabbing to the song Decay. The first band ends. People are going outside and room clear ups. You go get some merch. A shirt with old English font in black, a black hoodie with scribles and bubble font and have a chat with the band members. You spend your last dollars on merch. Who needs food right? . People are coming back inside the band xRespectxYouthx a Straight edge Metallic Hardcore band comes on. All their songs about Straight Edge and being positive. You go the front of the stage and you look around. Oh shit. Is it really her? you see that girl again from the last hardcore show. She cut her hair. It now is bangs with her hair to her shoulder (Idk what you call it but you guys can probably imagine it) The band is about to start. Dammit you need to get her attention but how? You look at her the lights coming down like a light from heaven like a spotlight shinning down on her. An angel with raven black dyed hair and a knocked loose hoodie that's way to big for her but she looks cute in it and a black beanie. You look at her the lights from the stage shines into her beautiful hazel eyes and snowwhite skin. The room opens up and it's just her moshing. Your heart starts to race. Her beautiful black hair sways from side to side. As she moshes. The way she moshes is like a ballerina fighting off ninjas. Gracefully moshing. You are in awe. Time stands still when you looked at her you are infatuated with her. Her face imprinted on angels. The way she mosh brought you into a trance. She spinkicked into your heart. Your heart beats faster than a powerviolence band like blasts beats thuming in your heart. It felt like in those romance movies where the guy first meets the girl and everything in the room disappears and it's just her. You start to feel all happy inside. You fell in love with the girl at the rock show. Is this love, you tell yourself? The band does a 10 minute speech on racism, being straight edge, hating cops and trump, says mother fucker every two words and tells everyone about respect than tells the crowd go kill and murder each other. Every song ends with him remiding everyone the band is Straight Edge. The singer with a black Bane hoodie wearing a hoodie over a Have Heart baseball cap screams into the mic. He walks back and forth with one hand high to his face his arms form a L shape. I WANT EVERY MOTHER DUCKER TO OPEN THIS PIT AND KILL EVERYONE I WANT TO SEE BLOOD AND GUTS 2020 NORTHWEST HARDCORE MOTHER DUCKER (CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG). Peope start piling up and grabing the micphone like people trying to get the last tv in black Friday. The room smells like weed, beer, sweat, e vape and piss. The smells suffokates you and you can’t seem to breathe. the screamer and everyone yells "" STRAIGHT EDGE FOR LIFE"" he jumps and makes a werid blegh, oof, ugh like a sick constipated guy and the whole room goes ape shit. You push everyone way and start spin kicking, crowdkilling and stage diving kind of like a peacock trying to attract a mate. People fall and blood starts to spill. A couple of teeths go flying into the sky. People started pushing each other and look like they are trying to fight invisible ninjas. You push yourself into the crowd and you throw a tiny 14 year old wearing a title fight hoodie and harry potter glasses and emo hair into the crowd. A shirtless overweight bald guy who with tattoos throws punches and jumps a little bit before pushes himself into a guy. His fat giggles. He pushes himself into a skinny guy with long hair wearing a backward cap, skinny black jeans and a vein windbreaker. The only non-causian guy in the local hardcore band shirt stading  in the background drinking a beer. The dude in the metal shirt head banging behind the mosh pit and occcianlly pushes the moshers. A guy who looks like the singer for Hams Way. He is probably super drunk. He screams FUCK YEAH and crushes his beer can with his head and spin kicks and knocks out a 14 year old girl in a pop punk shirt. Her mom than screams at the guy and the guy cries. Huh turns out that's his mom. A guy with plugs, black beanie and nails shirt stands on the side with cross arms and looks piss he's the drummer for solace. A girl who looks like Thron from hex girls shakes her water bottle and rocks back and forth. Shes the ex of the singer for xRespectxYouthx. a dude with a beard and blad hair, wearing a death metal shirt and  crust punk battlejacket with a discharge, infest, crass, bad brains and minor threat that costs 1000 dollars patches pounds his chest like a gorilla and throws a tiny little Asian kid with a Man overboard hoodie and blink 182 cap  into a merch table and than hits his head with a beer bottle. The dude flexes his muslces not his fucking head. A guy wearing a jesery with long hair, glasses, a beard and overweighted punches the overweight blad guy who looks way to old to go to shows. A girl with silver hair with long bangs and a girl with short orange double ponytail hair and girl with red hair long hair with bangs. They look like the goth girl from Filmore and teen drama island. They randomly hits a guy wearing a fannel shirt over a hoodie with a moustache and a beanie and a little bit of hair coming out of both side (idk how to explain it) and khaki pants. You go and start hitting and punching the adrenaline starts getting to you. You hope she noticed you. Than all of a sudden the world goes black. You wake up and you are on the ground. You get back up and the girl looks at you and screams like Jacob Bannon. A guy wearing an Expire hoodie and a tough shirtless guy faints, the band stops and ask if you are okay. You look at your arm the bones are sticking from your skin and blood is pouring down onto the cement ground that's already sticky from spilled beer. You smile at the girl but she pukes and runs away. While you were leaving in an ambulance you see the girl and another guy. A tall ginger hair guy probably 6 feet with facial hair, probably a whole lot older than her (my guess late 20s), tattoos on his legs, buff, plugs in his ears, wearing a black hoodie with old English font and camo shorts even though it's winter. You go back home and cry to The Story Overboard, Joysmithhaus and some acoustic pop-punk and drowning your sorrows in vegan non alcoholic root beer. You go through photos of that goth girl on her tumblr. Her tumblr page filled with pictures of her tattoos, Wiccan stuff, and her black cat named after a witch. The girl is pretty much Thorn from hex girl. You wipe away the tears and get out your Akai MPK beat maschine. You get out your microphone and starting singing with an autotune fake british accent like all those early 2000s emo bands over a sample of my Heroin with 808s. Songs about a goth girl and rejection You realized the only way to win her heart is to become a emo rapper. You change your name from xBroxChadx to Lil Depresssadboi. It only takes one rejection from a girl to make even the most toughest guy into a sad emo rapper. "

If you have a question that isn't answered here, try searching on the sub to see if hasn't already been asked, and if it hasn't been and you think it'll create an interesting discussion on the sub then post it up! 

FAQ

""What is Punk?""

 It's a music genre, culture, and fashion, if you wanna know more you can check out [the Punk page on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock), or books like Under the Big Black Sun by John Doe and Tom DeSavia, and Please Kill Me by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain, or documentaries like The Decline of Western Civilization, Clockwork Orange County, Another State of Mind, or any of the other hundreds of pages, books, and movies dedicated to Punk and it's history.

""I'm new to Punk what should I listen to first""

 There is so much fantastic Punk music, but I am going to give some Punk albums that I believe to be quintessential and should be required listening. (This is just my opinion obviously there are hundreds of amazing Punk albums but I definitely think this is a great jumping off point)

Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables - Dead Kennedys

The Ramones - The Ramones

Damaged - Black Flag

Damned Damned Damned - The Damned

Los Angeles - X

London Calling - The Clash

Bad Brains - Bad Brains

""What is Lace code? Is Lace Code still followed?"" 

 Lace code is mostly dead, certain people still follow it and it is stronger in some places than others. Lace code is telegraphing your beliefs, actions or group with the color of your laces. It only applies to ladder lacing on black combat boots. It is also primarily used by Skinheads but is also used by Punks.

Black laces = Neutral/No meaning

White laces = Racist/Nazi/White Power

Red = Nazi or in certain places RedSkin/RASH (Red and Anarchist Skinheads)

Yellow = SHARP (Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice)/Anti-racist

Personally I wear Pink laces, and that just means I like the color Pink

""What do you think of G.G. Allin?""

He was a rapist stop talking about him

""Where do I get Punk clothing?""

There are plenty of online stores you can get Punk stuff from, but the best Punk gear is always DIY, you feel more confident in it because you made it yourself and it creates more fun and interesting conversations when you are out and about or at a show (eventually). So try thrifting and creating your own stuff, go to r/BattleJackets for more help on that. It's also important to support bands, especially now, so hit up your local bands for merch or the online stores of some of those bigger bands you wanna rep. 

""Gatekeeping isn't Punk""

We know thanks."
201,9.947771828971125e-80,1.0,"Hardcore is more than music. Its a cliche, but its true. Hardcore has helped me through 2 addictions, mental health issues, family issues (im not kidding when I say im a Kyle), and from suicide. Hardcore has been a genre for over 40 years, and in that time it has never ""peaked"" or died, unlike every other genre of heavy music (arguably all music) in the last 50 year's. It has a community that makes it so impactful on so many people's lives. Its the reason if you go to a show you'll see both angsty teenagers at shows and guys in their 40s who have been going to shows since their teens. When i was first getting into hardcore, around 15-16 i just figured they liked the music.

 I started to understand once i actually started to deal with stuff. It was late in my sophomore year, and i needed to pass ( i dont come from a great town, and my family doesn't have money), and for about 3 weeks, i stayed up until 2 or 3AM every night, fueled by my snorted medication, and hardcore. I listened to the classics, like black flag and minor threat, and newer stuff like restraining order and Pears. Before this, i listened to it but didnt really care about the message, but during those long nights I started to understand the anger and dedication of the music, and started to pay attention to the lyrics.  

Then shit started to happen in my life, and i started to understand why people listened to hardcore for decades. You see, im autistic. To make a long story short, for years i viewed autism like i was taught, as a disease. This led to extreme self doubt and depression. And it was around this time, early 2019 that i developed a addiction to focalin, the medication i was prescribed, which i originally snorted to do homework better. I started to snort it more and more to try and cover up my issues. It worsened and worsened over the summer, during which i went to my first show. 

I remember at my first show. It was August 27, and I was standing outside of an elks lodge, which i was told was called ""hardcore stadium"" (which, admittedly makes it sound much more impressive than it really is)i was terrified, thinking my social anxiety would be crippling (just keep in mind that i got bad anxiety buying gum at a store), but instead, the opposite happened, and i finally understood why hardcore meant so much to people.  For the first time in years i felt safe in my skin. I could stim (fidgeting that autistic people to calm down), without feeling like a retard, i felt safe in a hot, cramped basement full of people who terrified me at first. The noise and cramped, hot basement didn't make me panic, it made me feel the safest and most comfortable i had felt in years. The sense of community is unlike anything I had experienced. I could be who i was, and not be judged or hated for it. That idea wouldnt fully set in for another few months unfortunately, but hey at least i got it eventually

Im just realizing that this is more about me than hardcore (my bad, ill try to make it more than just me), but anyway back to my crippling addiction. School had started back up, and all the people who i had called ""friends"" were in other classes. I also got my prescription doubled, and i figured out how to make alcohol. This led to a month and a half of heavy pill use and drinking, which almost killed me several times. Looking back, i realize that i was attempting to deal with the consequences of repressing my identity, both autism and homosexuality. During this time, i stopped listening to hardcore, calling it ""too pc"", (yeah I had pretty terrible views on society. i was going down the path of reactionary thinking. I never got to far down the path, but i was still a POS, and led me to being really homophobic, transphobic and anti pc). During this time, i would frequently overdose, (which in one occasion led to psychosis, that had me seeing maggots crawling in my skin) get into fights with my parents, and the few people who i got got along with cut me off. 

Then i got clean, (dont worry im getting back to hardcore) and it was during this time that i got away from my toxic mindset of self hatred and hateful thinking. I realized that my identity (the autism anyway) wasnt something to be fixed. I remember being alone, sober, still getting into fights with my parents, and the only thing that was there for me was hardcore. The only place i felt accepted for who i am was in the cramped, hot basements and back rooms of hardcore shows. For once, i was told to think for myself, and not to hide it. (I know how cringey that sounds, i apologize). I remember at the release show for vantage point's ep ""an answer you wont find"" (great ep btw), the vocalist of vantage point saying in between songs (roughly, my memory aint great) ""shoutout too all the people who are struggling every day to be independent, to stay free, and not suck off some corporation."" And i remember this line vividly, because thats exactly what it felt i had been doing for all these years. Not corporations, but the mental health system. 

So yeah. To an outsider it may just seem cringey (and it is, but not due to the music genre) and like the music had nothing to do with it, just like the scene kids did back in 2010. But I assure you this is different. Hardcore bands arent motivated by money, cuz if they were they would play literally any genre outside of hxc/ extreme metal. They play the music out of their passion for the music and culture. That genuine passion is what has kept the genre alive for almost 40 years, from minor threat in 83, to gulch just a few weeks ago. 

Anyway, after that came the worst phase of my life *the scene phase*. yes i listened to scene music in 2019, and no i don't want to talk about it. Moving on, there's not much to say. My life is way better now, largely in thanks to hardcore. Its always there to support you, (and knock sense into you if your a pos like I was). 

So yeah, the statement, ""hardcore is more than music"" is cringey, but it doesn't make not true. What seems like just a bunch of angry guys in basements is really an entire culture. A culture that accepts people, as long as they arent RAC or simaler, and gives them a place to feel comfortable. I dunno, i might be entirely wrong as well, but hey it's probably a mistake to post this anyway but ive already written it all, and its about time I contribute this sub more than just making jokes about me punching my dad. Also, once shows start back up again, and you see me at a show, come over and say hi! (Im the tall white kid akwardly pacing and fidgeting in the back)"

If you miss any band you can point me down, i may have forgotten a lot of them"
1206,5.195699510375233e-60,1.0,"(I already tried typing this post once before and it failed on me right before I posted it so I'll be a bit blunt here because I'm grieving over the loss of what was a pretty damn good post.) 

Anyways, recently I've been looking into punk ideologies and the subcultures and all that (mainly because I realized that I tend to agree with a lot of the political views and shit), and I stumbled across a subculture about Riot Grrrls.

I kind of freaked out, because it was just about the most *badass* thing I've ever learned of.

I mean, the whole feminist shit and using what you have to go against the norms that the patriarchy has established for you kind of thing? I fucking love that. I adore it.

I've learned that there's so many ways to piss off old, straight sexist men - body modifications, doing crazy shit with your hair, getting tattoos, etc. - but I'd love to focus more on the fashion and makeup aspect of it.

I want to draw on crazy shit on my face and wear cute, kickass clothes that have meaning (like embracing my femininity but on *my* terms) and be loud and unforgiving when someone says some sexist, homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, what have you shit, y'know? I don't want to be passive anymore.

I also love it because I've always had a shitty time embracing my femininity; I thought that to do that I had to be effortlessly pretty and nice and soft and all that shit.

*Hell no!*

As I learned more about feminism, the movement that I used to see before as unnecessary and misogynist and stupid became a movement that I support with my whole heart (literally just a little bit of research made me go ""*holy shit!*"").

I want to do crazy shit. I want to wear bold makeup and some big platform boots and skirts and shirts with messages that *mean* something to me. I want to create art as a form of expressing my rage against this stupid patriarchy and make zines and scream along to the music and shit.

I really want to be a Riot Grrrl (is that the right terminology? Can I refer to myself as a ""Riot Grrrl""?), but I need to know for certain; is this mentality enough to be able to call myself a Riot Grrrl? Is my idea of the subculture correct? I'm new to punk. I've heard about it before, an ex of mine was mildly obsessed with it, but I never though about it for *myself* until recently. I just want to learn as much as I can. Thank you :)"

[How the mighty have fallen.](https://preview.redd.it/xzbvo0aastb51.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0397035d05c299289d433924652d0e1c669c7fd0)

Maximum Rocknroll was on the forefront of punk in the -80s and -90s. But MRR has fallen low from the days when Tim Yohannan ran it as a personal obsession.

MRR went from Tim’s driving passion to a California C Corporation run by an anonymous Board of Directors after Tim died. MRR has always pretensions for the punk scene’s PC police but they have been skirting the law in reality always also. The MRR corporation operates by exploiting the all-volunteer labor of punk rockers who are coordinators, shitworkers and contributors for the magazine. In California it’s illegal for corporations to use volunteer labor to run their business without paying people for their work. The MRR print magazine ended in May 2019 and MRR is now completely online digital only. But they are still a corporation that operates by exploiting volunteer labor instead of paying people their due.

By September 2019 a MRR coordinator sued the corporation for back wages. Her name is Victoria Cassis and she sued MRR through the State of California Labor Commissioner’s Office. State Case Number WC-CM-714115CW. MRR hired a Berkeley law firm but they realized soon they couldn’t win the case because what MRR did and is still doing is illegal. So MRR settled with Vicky Cassis out of court for $11,000 in back wages. The reason no one hears about this is because MRR made Vicky sign a non-disclosure agreement to exchange for the settlement and all public records are sealed. But that didn’t stop MRR from harassing Vicky Cassis even after they paid her back wages. Vicky’s band Coherence went on tour in the Pacific Northwest and MRR goons called all the venues and forced the band to cancel the tour. MRR has plenty of other dark secrets.

If you ever volunteered for MRR you were illegally exploited. You are being illegally exploited now if you volunteer for MRR. You are rightfully owed payment for your work. Stop being exploited! Demand the money MRR owes you!"
786,1.499539570263065e-52,1.0,"I started my musical journey loving Adam and the Ants and Shakin Stevens! Early '80s, I probably got my first cassette player in 1980 or so. The first album I ever bought with my own money was Powerage by AC/DC, it's still my favourite album and Sin City is still my favourite song.

In High School I became a metalhead, secretly loved pop and soul, but on the outside I was all about thrash and speed metal. Shock metal like W.A.S.P. and gradually learned to love the crossover between metal and punk. Still, to this day, Suicidal Tendencies are my second favourite band, AC/DC will always hold their crown.

I played Slayer and Death Angel and Kreator and Acid Reign etc. to piss my parents off, to make them listen to me while I defended myself.

When I got to college and was introduced to music like Public Enemy, Dead Kennedys and REM I started realising that the music I wanted my parents to hate had a purpose!

Dead Kennedys especially caught my interest, these were songs I could understand politically, arguments and ideas that resonated with my own developing political ideals. I listened to more punk, but it really didn't do much for me, UK Subs &amp; The Exploited etc sang about lost jobs and Thatcher. She was long gone at that stage. Sex Pistols were catchy but I preferred the Megadeth version.

Got a professional job, got married, had a kid, went into a musical hiatus for many years, loved REM &amp; Crowded House, but reverted to the more alternative chart music.

Then I found Tony Hawk on Playstation! Rise Against, Flogging Molly, all this wonderful music I had missed. Started discovering music again, found NOFX, Pennywise, Less than Jake... Started becoming politically aware again, started thinking again, because of this music.

Fast forward through divorce, financial collapse, several disastrous relationships, coming out as bi, discovering motorbikes and rediscovering guitars...

I am now, at 48, the person I wish I was at 18, not knowledge or experience, just someone who is kind. Punk culture, punk people, punk bands, punk audiences, are kind. I've never felt love like I've felt love at at a punk show, getting a selfie with Jerry Only or just chilling with the crowd before seeing Rise Against. We CARE for each other, we love each other, we look after each other, we make sure that our most vulnerable members are looked after and are kept safe.

We look outward, we see injustice and we stand up and shout and march, we fight the government when it is wrong. We fight for a better world, a just world, a free world, a caring world. For all of us.

We are Punks, we are Love, we care, we look scary but we love kittens and puppies and are anti suffering even if we aren't vegan, if we are vegan we don't preach about it, we only want to scare the unjust authorities and take care of our own.

For a sub culture that look like extras from a Mad Max movie we are the most responsible humans for this planet."

I’m serious, I’m giving you one last chance to leave and not listen to a controversial opinion. This isn’t a vent for the faint of heart, let’s just say that. 



Ok, here goes... 
Honestly it feels like these days punk has become what it claims to fight against. They scorn censorship and societal ideals, yet they rail against anybody who doesn’t think exactly like them. How can you claim to fight against oppression when you’re oppressing your own people?? If you’re not a leftist (conservatives??? In MY punk community?? It’s more likely than you think!) then everybody is trying to disown you and shake you off like someone would with a booger and they’re screaming “EWWW CONSERVATIVE COOTIES GET IT OFF GET IT OFF!!!!” 
When in reality I’m every bit as punk as anybody else! Just because I’m not voting for the same person as you doesn’t mean anything. We still have the same mindset. We still have the same taste in music and fashion, and we still both detest mainstream orthodoxy. We still question authority and are independent fighters. We still want to fight for what’s morally right, and we won’t let anybody intimidate us into silence and submission. We both believe in aggressively being ourselves even if other people don’t like it, and not changing for other people or to fit in or whatever. And we both hate Nazi ideology, too!! Conservative punks and your typical liberal punks- they’re really the same at the end of the day. 
But yet... I’m constantly told that I’m not really punk. I get called all kinds of names and shamed. ... People trying to shame me into silence and submission, where have I heard that before...? It’s just really hypocritical that they rebel against censorship and hivemind mentality yet they do it themselves in their own community, picking and choosing who’s “really punk” and who’s “a poser”. 
I guess what I’m saying is... I really need some friends, at least a portion of the punk community that’ll welcome me and accept me, rather than rejecting me and stomping me into the ground. I really want to be loved and belong, not be forced to fight for my place in a group that claims to be against the cliquey, exclusive nature of the mainstream popular stuff. 
Go on ahead and delete this, I’m sure that this post will quickly become a hot target, but at least I can say I tried. At least hopefully one person will understand me. Hopefully I’ve made some kind of sense."
342,8.404096506094623e-42,1.0,"I see a lot of punk metal heads talking a lot of shit about Nazi’s and fascism, and I completely agree with it all, there is no place for that kind of political party as of today or ever.

However I do wish people could stop making other punk metal heads look bad by falsely accusing others of being a fascist or a Nazi, and maybe it would help by also learning more about the history of true fascism instead of the obvious, it’s suppresses voices, goes against equality, ect.

I’ll openly say now that I do find some of our current presidents political takes to be very helpful to the country and in the same ways I don’t fully agree with him, I would never vote for him however I find we were given a shitty hand of politicians who all have their pros and cons.

But back on topic, I’ve been called a fascist and racist for weeks because I simply said I find trumps political takes to be good, in my personal experience, saying that alone will spread like wild fire amongst people, regardless if I said I would never vote for him, people have continuously harassed me. It’s gotten so bad I was fired from my current place of work for being “racist” and me supporting hate groups even though I completely stand for and sometimes if I have time, join with community’s who fight against racism, fascism, ect; I have had to move from a country to another just to make sure I could still get a job and make ends meet, and luckily I have.

As for my traveling I have found comfort back in the community through people who do find it to be rather stupid and upsetting that people are constantly harassed due to false accusations of being a fascist amongst other things."

921,1.777290685237188e-38,1.0,"I’ll start by saying that I myself am an African-American and I believe that these protests were bound to happen. My community is angry at all the injustices. The ones that happen on and off camera. I don’t hate all cops (even though that’s popular), I see people as individuals and I believe many cops, especially minority cops, goal is to serve and protect communities. At the same time the justice system in this system is horrible. It gives far more protection to cops then it does the people who need the most protection and cops always assume that minority groups, especially black and latino people, are up to no good. Something has to change but I don’t think that means being reckless.

Minority groups are more likely to die from Covid-19. These protests are going to continue to kill more black and brown people who live in the US. The groups are simply too large for their not to be people becoming infected in one way or another from this entire ordeal. Another things is it’s effect on the environment. People are reckless, throwing trash and signs and burning things up, and overall, it’s very bad for the environment. Lastly it’s effect on small businesses. Simply put, small businesses in the area, many of which are owned by minority groups, will be unable to recover from this financially. Even if they have insurance that’s doesn’t consider the fact that it’s going to take time to clean up and rebuild and more money to replace burned or stolen items. This will cost far more money and take far more time then a small business could reasonably continue with no business at all considering all of this is being done just to be able to get business again. A target can rebuild. A mom and pop bar cannot. This is the sad reality of the situation and is going to end up taking money out of minority pockets as these business owners are forced to get another job and members of the community are forced to spend their money elsewhere."
1183,1.9664735279137447e-38,1.0,"I’ve seen a few posts about emo and whether or not it’s punk. I thought I’d try to clear that up because I know a lot of people on this sub are not huge fans of emo at all or only extend to the DC Dischord Records releases in the genre.

The basic answer is, when it began yes but now it’s not necessarily.

Emo originated in the mid-80s DC Hardcore scene where it began as a more emotional expressive and melodic form of hardcore with bands like Rites of Spring, Embrace, and Dag Nasty. These bands took direct influence from Minor Threat and Bad Brains. Later members of Rites of Spring and Embrace formed Fugazi who are decidedly not emo. In Maryland there were bands like Moss Icon and The Hated that formed and the genre started to spread more across the country with bands like Jawbreaker in NY removing the hardcore elements and instead focusing on a more heartfelt punk approach to the genre.

By the mid-90s emo had spread across the US and into Japan where a few different genres formed. In San Diego and San Francisco screamo was pioneered by Portraits of Past, Heroin, Swing Kids and Antioch Arrow. The latter two bands helped create modern emo fashion with Swing Kids adopting the swoopy dyed black hair style and Antioch Arrow introdung dark makeup influenced by gothic rock. Non Screamo bands like Drive Like Jehu brought math rock influence to emo. All of these bands were closely tied to the hardcore scene and played alongside non emo bands. Screamo spread to Japan with groups like Envy. In the late 90s and early 2000s Screamo bands started taking influence from extreme styles of hardcore like grindcore and emoviolence to create the more aggressive style called emoviolence. Some of these bands include Pg.99, Orchid, Jeromes Dream, Usurp Synapse, and Circle Takes The Square. 

In North West, Midwest, and South West US a indie rock style of emo was created known as Midwest emo. This is where the departure from punk and hardcore musically comes from. The bands in this scene came from an array of backgrounds. Sunny Day Real Estate was a band from the Seattle grunge scene that took the loud choruses, distortion, and lazy vocals of grunge and fused it with the melodic nature of emo. The band people usually say is responsible for beginning this style is Cap’n Jazz who had a much more melodic, twinkly, and fun sound then the DC bands that was influenced by math and indie rock. The band still kept punk energy and occasionally used screamed vocals. Some other important bands in this scene include Mineral, Braid, Boys Life, American Football, Christie Front Drive, and Pedro The Lion, all of which are only punk bands in spirit.

Some Midwest emo bands started to fuse the genre with the mainstream pop punk and power pop of that era creating emo pop. Some of these bands include Jimmy Eat World, Get Up Kids, and The Promise Ring. Some mainstream bands like Weezer started to adopt a more emotional power pop approach as well with Weezer releasing the album Pinkerton, often credited with being an important album for emo pop and on for the first instances of an emo or emo-adjacent band reaching a mainstream audience.

Emo pop would spread to NJ and NY in the mid-90s and to early 2000s through a number of melodic hardcore and pop punk groups adopting the style in the area such as Lifetime, Saves The Day, Armor For Sleep, Midtown, Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, and My Chemical Romance (who would abandon many of their real emo influences following their debut album).

Many of the Midwest emo and emo pop bands grew up on punk and within the punk scene, some of which who were actually in hardcore bands such as James Dewees who began in the metalcore band Coalesce, before transitioning to the Get Up Kids. Or the members of Fall Out Boy who before releasing their debut album (which is regarding typically as emo pop though they later abandoned the genre) were members of the Chicago hardcore scene, with Pete Wentz especially being the vocalist of the metalcore band Arma Angelus and the bassist of grindcore band Racetraitor.

Long story short due to the constantly evolving nature of the genre many bands have strayed away from punk rock moving onto influences from other punk influences genres like pop punk and indie or even unrelated genres like indie folk and acoustic (in the case of Bright Eyes and Dashboard Confessional)."
63,2.4687276386205e-38,1.0,"Most patches are black and white, but I’d like to be able to throw some colour in there. Patches say things like “end police brutality” “fuck Nazis” “the first pride was a riot” “Stop racism” , “sinners before hypocrites” which are all black and white. 

If I get a black vest, would it look bad with mostly black and white patches but with splashes of random colour?

Should I just keep the black vest black &amp; white and make a separate blue denim one with colours? Should I just put all of them on a blue denim vest? 

 I’d like to get a black one if it wouldn’t look bad with random bits of colour, but my irl (not punk, just very feminine women) friends say I should go with blue denim. 

Some examples of the splashed of colour: a green patch of a molecule of a virus saying “if you can read this you’re too fucking close”, a red old style movie ticket saying “ticket to hell”, a cute little pink uterus that says “my body my choice”. 

Thanks so much in advance!"
869,5.733970390488909e-38,1.0,"I've played in a Dutch punkrockband for several years. Our lyrics were always about society, war and skateboarding/surfing. One day we played at a festival in an old German bunker. Upon arrival at the gig, we had some spare time and decided to have a couple of beers outside in the sun, relax and check out the public. Pretty soon we got our eyes on a tall guy in a brown suit who had dressed up as Hitler. 

At that time, I don't think any of us had encountered a Nazi out in the wild. Adding to that we were around 18/19 years old and just made some mocking jokes on him but didn't think much of it for the rest. ""Probably just a lone weirdo"" we assumed. But when it was time to enter the stage for a soundcheck and get up close with the crowd, we entered the bunker and got loudly boo'd by what we could now clearly see was an entire crowd full of right wing extremists. This wasn't a normal festival, this was some disgusting nazi gathering. And they apparently already knew we were anything but right wing.

Some of us wanted to leave but I insisted we stayed, using the argument that these are exactly the type of people that should hear our lyrics. Maybe it would allow us to convert one soul to reason and that would make it worth it.

After the initial booing, the crowd ended up loving the show. I doubt many were aware of the lyrics, but hopefully at least some were.

**My question is, what would you have done?**

Now, half a lifetime later, I sometimes think back and wonder if we made the right choice. I saw a post about Queen this week, that they were blacklisted by the U.N. for continuing to play in South Africa under apartheid. That made me recall the issue.

Also, my dad was a protester, not just during the 60's and 70's, but also later in life when he chaired a group that fought against ""useless violence"" (direct dutch translation) in society. He was very leftist, was invited to speak across the country and one day he did his regular speech, but in front of a crowd of a right wing extremist Dutch political party. He basically had the same thinking as I did, hoping to get in the heads of some of them with a message of tolerance. However afterwards, just because of being present there, he for years was put on a hitlist that could be found online from Antifa. It didn't make sense to him but it was still a bit scary for him cause he was worried they might target his family.

So I'm not sure what is the right way to approach such a matter and am curious as to your thoughts on it!"
1116,2.130504461990198e-37,1.0,"Ok so, as far as punks go, I am especially weird. The thing is, i have an extreme phobia of crowds.  So i Always only have 2 options: stand in the back (most manageable) stand in the front (least manageable, also I don't want to be an asshole to the people who waited for hours) The weird thing is, i've never gotten drunk because my entire body is extremely sensitive to alcohol (I start coughing and choking if I drink a small sip of red wine) 

But last summer, I had an amazing experience. Me and a friend of mine attended a Foo Fighters show (I know it's not necessarily that much of a punk band, but I need to get this point across) and we were standing right in the middle of the crowd. That summer, i was unhealthily skinny (I was at the brink of an eating disorder) and I almost fainted several times before. The show started, and I slowly started getting dizzy, and I could feel the blood leaving my face As the crowd closed in on me. But right next to us, i saw a mosh pit starting to open. And I knew: if I don't start moving, I will faint and miss out on one of the Best concerts of my life. So i grabbed my friend by the wrist and literally told him: „If anything goes wrong, toss me on top of the crowd"" and I jumped, with my skinny, underfed ass straight into the mosh pit. 

And... I didn't faint. I made it through. And that was when I realised: Punk isn't about politics. Not About mohawks, not about leather jackets. Not even about the alcohol or the drugs that I never had. Punk is that little voice in your head, that screams „Fuck It!"". As far as i was concerned, I could've fallen to the ground and got stomped. But as Dave Grohl was screaming „All my life"", i decided that I don't care. That for once in my life, i won't give a shit about myself and just become one with that euphoric feeling of „Fuck everything"" 

Since then, I changed As a person. I became more certain. Less insecure. Beforehand, I was an anxious little derp who never knew what he wanted. All it took was that one phrase.

„If anything goes wrong, toss me...""
That is the Essence of punk."
582,9.220604450460177e-37,1.0,"Hey, guys. I’ve been into punk music since around the same time I got into Nirvana. That was back in middle school, and now I’m 18. I listen to Ramones, Sex Pistols, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains, Flipper, Buzzcocks, and a lot of other punk/punk influenced bands from the 80s to the 90s, like Sonic Youth, Butthole Surfers, Bikini Kill, and Pixies. I come from a pretty conservative family, so I’m the only one in my house who listens to this kind of music. Naturally, that means I’ve had to discover all of this stuff myself. I recently took the time out to write down every band I listen to, and I noticed that my knowledge of punk music is limited to around 40 or less bands. This made me feel kinda bad, because punk is easily one of my favorite genres, if not my NUMBER ONE favorite genre, and I know there’s a ton of bands out there that I’ve heard of but I never actually got around to listening to them. So basically, I’d really love it if you guys could provide me with a list of bands that I can add to the ones I already listen to. I know 40 bands probably sounds like a lot, but when you’re constantly listening to music like I am, it really isn’t. I need more. It kinda makes me feel like a poser when I think about it, but I know that’s just my head getting the best of me. I just want to become more versed in my knowledge of the genre. So yeah, help a fellow punk out. And before I go, Nazi punks fuck off."
1682,4.544515594685737e-36,1.0,"Saw a comment on YouTube video of circle jerks the other day that said 

“True ""punk"" had nothing to do with fashion. In my eyes, the real punks back then were totally nondescript looking dudes like the Circle Jerks are in this video, and various other LA and DC hardcore bands from that era. Sporting the punk uniform was conformity in my eyes. Mohawks, expensive leather jackets and Doc Martens, expensive tattoos, piercings and Doc Martens, concert T-Shirts and tons of pins and patches. All that shit cost lots of money. Most ""real"" punks I knew were broke kids who couldn't afford tha shit, and wouldn't have been able to look like that even if they could because they were working shit jobs. Punk is and always will be a state of mind, not a fashion statement.”

1022,2.0243896339143896e-34,1.0,"I’m using the terms “old punk” and “young punk” to refer to how long someone has been a punk, not age. Anyways, so often I’ll see a young punk make a “fuck Nazis” post, “just got my first mohawk” post, or something cliche. Instead of supporting young, enthusiastic punks, old punks are shitting all over their spirit with comments like “so original” or “how about you do something original instead of following the corporate controlled image of punk”.

Yes, punk cliches have become more or less corporate controlled from stores like Hot Topic and Vans, but you’re not helping. Instead of saying “hey, maybe you can go to a food drive or  a local political protest instead of Nazi hunting” in an attempt to redirect their young spirit, you’re blatantly putting them down. Instead of helping guide young punks away from corporate influence, you’re just ridiculing them.

You’re just as bad as the corporations. You see the corporate influence on young punks and instead of helping them, you make them feel even worse. Stop being assholes to people who are trying. Fuck you."

So does anyone suggest any super easy way of making patches so I could stitch em on real fast without him knowing? Just to get at him.

He broke my mom's fucking back (trying to take her phone) and he's a closeted racist.

On the second day, we beat slaves mercilessly and their only escape from the beatings was singing spirituals with each other.  

On the third day, they weaved worried notes together into what we now know as the blues as a way to express their anguish.

On the fourth day, they continued to take our beatings and gave us rock and roll. 

On the 5th day, rock and roll reached new ears and anarchy spread to the UK. Soon after it took a long boat ride back to So Cal. 

On the 6th day, we had punk rock. We gave them 526 seconds of knee to the back of the neck. 

What are you gonna do tomorrow? After how much the black community has positively effected our lives isn't it our turn to positively effect theirs? If a song has ever saved your life then you owe your life to the black community. 

On the 7th day, can you really afford to rest when the people who have given us so much are hurting so badly? 

We always have this stupid fucking circular argument about what is and isn't punk. This is the one time where it's not up for debate. If you don't support our brothers and sisters right now while they fight for true freedom you have no business calling yourself punk. You're just wearing someone else's leather jacket and ripped jeans

Part of being punk is realizing that our culture, our identity was in part literally beaten out of African Americans. Without African American Spirituals there would be no London Calling. Without the blues there would be no Suburban Home or Hope. Without Rock and Roll there would be no American Jesus. 

Black culture is American culture. Opposing oppression is what true patriotism looks like. #blacklivesmatter

I got a great response from this community and have really enjoyed teaching the class (shout out to the few of you here who joined!).  

I wanted to let everyone know about a new class I just posted called [Combat Rock: Punk Rock and the Cold War](https://outschool.com/classes/combat-rock-punk-rock-and-the-cold-war-WRpHM2NZ#usS9usZPyx).  This is a two day class focusing on subversive punk on both sides of the Iron Curtain.  Day One will focus on the Western/capitalist world.  Through The Clash, Dead Kennedys, and Nena (yes, I know not traditionally punk but punk adjacent) we'll look at the nuclear arms race, US intervention in communist nations, and calls for peace.  Day Two will go behind the Iron Curtain to look at the punk scenes in the communist world.  We'll listen to Schleim Keim, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, and Tilt to learn about the Berlin Wall, Perestroika, and the eventual fall of communism.  

The class is taught via a platform called Outschool.  It's listed for students 13-18 years old, but I can happily accept students slightly younger (sorry not older) who are interested.  

You can get a $20 credit to Outschool by using the course link I posted above or [click here](https://outschool.com/2020-school-closures-offer#usS9usZPyx) to get the class for free (if funding is still available).

It's worth noting that his accounts (ahem, aside from being in Rancid, a band that has a lot to say about cops) have shown support of anti-police-brutality and in support of the protests. Also worth noting is that this aired a month ago, before the continent-wide-and-beyond demonstrations started. The organization he donated to services his town's healthcare workers, police, and, as he mentioned specifically, assisted-living facilities. Ultimately, his $20000 contribution will help police, which people in the punk community aren't too happy about. The punks who are staunchly ACAB are going so far as to give up on Rancid and The Used altogether, and I question whether this is fair, even in light of George Floyd's murder. There's still a pandemic on and the PPE that winds up being used by police serves to protect not only themselves, but the people they come in contact with, which actively reduces harm coming from law enforcement agents.

528,6.226793920537126e-30,1.0,"So it’s really trendy to hate  on this movie and just say they look like actors, so many facts wrong, anarchy = order.

I’ll tell why you’re wrong.


I feel like this movie is super tight. It came out at the right time 1998 going into 99 was before punk became totally totally digitized and mainstreamized like a few years after in the 00s. 

I can’t disagree with most of their beliefs. 

Steveos analysis is the best I’ve seen in any punk film which outside of the the 80s ones is usually just superficial and surface level stuff about Anarcho punks or drinking, concert going or adventures. 

His breakdown of the 80s scene, chaos and anarchy, philosophy, lifestyle and beliefs  isn’t actually bullshit and illogical. 

Even the fashion is spot on. People mixed up flannel or button up shirts with funky or everyday clothing. It wasn’t always a band shirt etc 

It’s pretty accurate. Maybe a few things were a bit off towards the end but it’s super solid. 

There were well established authors ( individualist and ontological anarchists) who mix chaos and anarchy together or as the same  giving what his particular brand of anarchism is some merit. Also the way he broke it down is pretty solid.

Look up TAZ ( CHAOS the broadsheets of ontological anarchism) 

The only part is the way the subculture is downplayed towards the end is a bit cheap
and the reasoning of anarchy essentially representing what they were fighting against. 

Also bobs acting is a bit questionable at times."

I havent even gone to a protest since I was kid, but I use punk and heavy metal music to vent my frustrations about life and my economic situation. I dont even hang out with other punks these days because the scene is just full of insane dangerous people. Im a peaceful punk. Im angry but Im older now. Too old to be moshing and getting my head smashed in by strangers.

I guess what Im saying is that Im definitely a heavy metal punk, definitely a loner, and absolutely am peaceful. Its probably silly to worry about this kind of thing at my age, but what am I supposed to do? Emotions dont stop after you turn 18.

1053,8.640720636011571e-28,1.0,"I totally understand wanting to fit in &amp; look cool and listen to all the right bands. I wasted a lot of time and energy when I was 14 or 15 trying to do exactly that.

 But if fitting in and looking cool and listening to all the right bands is everything you want out of this community then you're at best selling yourself short and at worst posing harder than you can imagine. This is a culture that you participate in &amp; learn about just like any other. It's not like there's a punk rulebook that the rest of us can just recite back to you. If you really feel like it's necessary do some reading about the history surrounding this scene but honestly it's probably better to get your taste from whatever's popular in your local underground. 

Someone in another thread made what I feel like is a very important point- don't put punk on some pedestal that other genres and subcultures can't measure up to ever. Punk is extremely nebulously defined (&amp; in a lot of ways lacks definition) and it's absolutely possible to behave in ways that are ""unpunk"" by most people's definitions- and that's okay. This isn't for everyone. We aren't some cool cultural elite. I'm some dork who likes it when the drums go fast &amp; the cops get things thrown at them. That's cool to me but maybe not to another person- &amp; I'm not any cooler than anyone else. If you listen to more soft singer-songwriter indie pop than anything else &amp; were thinking about voting for elizabeth warren, that's fine, you are a valid &amp; probably wonderful human being, just don't be surprised when someone wearing a spikey jacket does a double take when you call yourself punk. That isn't a reflection of what punk is empirically as much as it is what most people who participate in punk agree that it is. 

It's so incredibly hard to describe the diversity of possible experience in what we call ""punk""- it isn't as narrow as a lot of people make it out to be. But it isn't something you can strive to be so much as you just are in attitude &amp; action. Speaking as a mod here, this sub is barely a facsimile of what punk truly is &amp; it could never measure up to the real thing. (When it's safe and advisable) go outside &amp; find where the shows near you are. Try and make some friends and experience this yourself, instead of being that goober trying to impress aggressively online reddit punx. You don't need to look like a perfect crustlord at the first gig you ever go to or even the second or the third or ever.  This isn't an aesthetic to adopt and front on social media, it's something you participate within and contribute to. It is a lived experience not an image. Go live it."

I got beat up, bullied, and tossed aside in middle school.  I found punk then, but not fully.  I was pissed off and honestly a bit suicidal, but...

Punk music means more to my life then most will ever know, because it taught me how to fight.

Before the gut wrenching anxiety hit, high school did.  I beat the fucking shit out of my middle school bully outside of the PE locker rooms, he squealed while I hit him, one of the more satisfying moments of my childhood.

That fight isn't what I'm talking about, but it seemed like a catalyst.

I got into drugs in high school.  Fuck, I sold them too.  I went overboard one time with Adderall/booze/and an oversized hit from a ""zong"" and hit the floor probably still reeling from opium.

By the time I was 19, I'd been to the ER multiple times thinking I was dying of a heart attack.  Good ole panic attacks.  The good new was I was playing guitar for actually two punk bands.

Punk found me at a place no one should ever be. 

But, it taught me to fight.  It taught me to quit thinking about killing myself.  It taught me to stand up for myself.  It taught me confidence.  It taught me to think for my fucking self.  It taught me that I can rely on good people and that I didn't have to walk alone.  It taught me to be a person that people respect.

In present day, it's taught me to be a Union leader.  And I'll be fucking damned if people don't look at me funny while there's a tie around my neck headed off to work with Reagan Youth blasting inappropriately loudly out my car windows.

542,1.15273828243911e-26,1.0,"Anyone with an understanding of music theory knows Steve Jones and Glen Madlock, the guitarist and bassist, composed all the music of the Sex Pistols.  Some even had lyrics.  At first Steve Jones was the singer, later hiring John Lydon to sing. Similar to Steve’s incompetence leading to something interesting, John’s lack of skill as a singer led to “anti-singing” and was very influential.  That to me is the extent of his legacy.  Right place at the right time, had a creative approach to singing.  

His touch of political lyrics while different was hardly the first; John Lennon a few years before wrote a lot of music with politically conscious lyrics.  IMO Lydon lifted that from Lennon. “Nevermind the Bollocks” was completed instrumentally, and all John did was sing over completes tracks. “Silly Thing”, one of the best Sex Pistols songs, was done without John, which proves my point.

Since then he’s suffered from narcissism, egomania, and a slave to how the media wants him to be. In his recent interviews and autobiographies he thinks so highly of himself and proceeds to criticize and rip on everyone.  Holier than thou. Literally claims he Single handedly invented punk music as well as the fashion! Claims Malcolm got all of his ideas from him.  He hardly has a positive review for any of his contemporaries and denies being influenced by anyone. He claims he “revolutionized music twice” with his second band PIL. That more than anything is utterly untrue.  Iggy Pop made a post-punk album “The Idiot” years before PIL.

Musicians in the music industry know this. Hardly anyone can stand him, which is why the Sex Pistols don’t perform anymore.  He’s been able to trick everyone else, picking up accolades , giving countless interviews, and allowing journalists and layman to attribute so much to him.

Johnny “Rotten”.  He is a liar, fraud, conceited, narcissistic, cruel, arrogant, hypocritical, and pretentious.  I can go on and on with more adjectives and just ripping him to pieces.  

The reason for this posts is besides his own band members like Steve Jones putting him down, I see nothing but praise and reverence for this overrated fraud."

im 17, and begun listening to punk music last year. i used to listen to alternative rock, and spent my last two years with metal. with so many family issues and depression, i was bullied and other shit. classmates and others at school would say i wasnt worth communicating and i was so low on self esteem. i had these classmates which would talk about bands and i would just wanna talk with them so bad, but if i did they would just joke about it like ""who knew this girl would know these songs, haha"". (my english is just too bad
..sorry) they had really big prejudice about my physcial appearence which made me feel worse. 
anyways, there were two ""punks"" in my classroom last year and weren't that nice to me, i wasnt sure how id call myself but i loved punk music too. later, with a fake id, i met lots of people online and ive got friends i still talk to. i still use that account and because of quarantine, some of my online friends decided to open new chat groups, and in one of them there is also these two classmates from earlier. 
till that group was created, i just wish i would go to another city in university and as i would be 18, i could go to concerts and make friends. but now i kinda realize that almost all the ""punks"" i knew till today were into alcohol, drugs and smoking. (those two would say i was such a innocent baby cause i didnt smoke)
i dont care about people drinking near me and the reason why i cant is my health issues. but in friend groups everyone is smoking and drunk, my head is full of thoughts... i was also bullied about am i muslim or not which im not religous at all, i just have pills i gotta take which even if i wouldnt have, why would i have to? 
there are so many threads about 'you dont have to dress black wear converse and other shit just feel punk'  but what about smoking and alchocol?

This pandemic is going to be the final nail in the coffin of most of the independent record stores, and a lot of the labels and distributors that was putting vinyl into those stores.

But it isnt the pandemic that's to blame. You are to blame.

Because you support silicon valley companies like Bandcamp. Because you get your punk music from Google (aka Youtube). Because you have done this for years, instead of supporting that cool punk record store down the street, or ordering vinyl from Interpunk.

Your decisions caused this. YOU. 

Some of us put our lives into this thing, and you just sat there behind your iPhone(tm) making cute remarks while some of us mortgaged our homes to try to keep an independent alternative alive.

By the end of this year, there may be no more record stores left. And the ones that are left may not have any distributors to buy from. 

Do you like vinyl? Well enjoy paying $40 for reissue vinyl off Amazon, since you were too lazy to pay $10 for a new punk record at your local record store.

But you won't notice, will you? You'll just keep giving Apple 99 cents to load a song onto your super punk $500 smartphone(tm), or being really edgy and giving it to Bandcamp instead.

THAT is your scene. 
THAT is who you are. 
Because YOUR ACTIONS show us who you really are.

So keep it up! Enjoy this new world you have made! Because this is you.

(You fucking hashtag, corporate-dick-sucking, lame ass poseurs who think you are rebels; you can go fuck yourselves.)

Dave Swanson targets YOUNG GIRLS of color to manipulate and abuse   
I want to talk about my story because apparently it's okay to take advantage of young girls, lie about drug use, lie about STDs, and deny all forms of cheating and abuse!  

Dave and I saw eachother when I was into the scene in chicago and he told me he was in a band which I don't remember but it was a number (Fact check i dont fucking remember) and a band with his ex girlfriend who I have  never met.

Dave is really sweet at first and is like your best friend right off the bat, he makes you feel comfortable, he tells you his stories, tells you how much he cares about you and introduces you to all his friends. Now that I remember everything CLEARLY i can't believe this guy has friends from all the lying and manipulative things he did.

Dave was talking to another person right before I stopped hearing from him and, he did it to the next girl (who contacted me somehow) and Im sure hes done it again and again. He is abusive as hell, as soon as I got to know him being around him was like being around a bomb. AND NOTHING IS HIS FAULT, every time he explodes at you its because ""hes loud or had a bad day or he is having panic attack"" He makes you believe he is an accepting guy but is secretly judging you and everyone he knows he talks shit about. I thought he was just kidding but he even talks shit about these two girls that he calls them best friends. He was open about him being addicted to heroin but because I was young and dumb, we didnt use condoms and I got an STD. Later on I told my now boyfriend he started asking me questions about him. Then my bfs friends and my friends started asking me questions about him. I was confused because I was over him but apparently being with him made me weirder.

Guess what I went to therapy and realized: Dave Swason is a manipulator, he gets you to spend money on him, he uses his trauma to get exactly what he wants, he cries to gaslight you, he steals from you (over $100 worth of thstuff), he lies to you about body safety (he gave me STD AND didnt tell me he was doing sex for money WHILE WE WERE DATING), he lies to his friends in front of your face and then tells you why later, he uses people for their house, for their drugs, for their attention.  He tells you he is not racist, homophobic, or sexist but he makes ALL THOSE JOKES and says someone else said them, he talks LIKE A PIG about womens bodies, he is not a safe person. He has never been a safe person. TELL YOUNG GIRLS AND ALL GIRLS THAT DAVE SWANSON IS AN ABUSER. It would not surprise me if I was not the only one and It would not surprise me to learn that he has did rapey acts before. 

I dont want to get too explicit to preserve mine and my boyfriends privacy but Dave manipulates people into sex and lies to you about his clean status. I have been recovering from my BRIEF time with him ever since because it was sooooo hiddenly traumatizing. I am speaking out because I now have the words to talk about the abuse that went on. A girlfriend should NOT have to talk to down from hurting yourself because I said something that made you feel bad, a girlfriend should NOT have to find out you are doing drugs behind her back and not caring for safety (uses needles), a girlfriend should not have to find out that you were sleeping around doing sex for money, a girlfriend should not have to feel scared everytime you are mad, a girlfriend should not have to PAY for everything even though you said you had a job, a girlfriend should not have to get STDs as a surprise from you, a girlfriend should not have to see you treat everyone like shit, a girlfriend should not have to feel so manipulated that you don't know which way is up.

When I met dave he told me that people didn't like him, that he learned from his past, and that I can trust him. WRONG. I will say he is an abuser, liar, and puts people at risk for STDS. My friend and BF are saying that he is a sexual assaulter because of the stories i told them around sex (he would convince me to do things i didnt want to) and because he didnt use condoms when i would ask, AND because he was doing sex for money without telling me. I know he seems like he has changed but he hasnt until he starts ADMITTING how much of a slimeball he is. 

The reason im posting this is for 3 reasons:  1) Dave gave me an STD and because I didnt know what was wrong with me so long it got worse if he told me he was cheating or doing sex for money i could have gotten help sooner

2) because I know how people around him don't think hes capable of this, IM TELLING YOU HE IS, HE HAS PROBABLY LIED AND STOLEN FROM YOU TOO

3) because my friend ran into someone during covid that used to be friends with his ex girlfriend and told me HOW HE ABUSED HER PHYSICALLY TURNED HER ONTO DRUGS AND WAS SO SO SO MANIPULATIVE

This is a grown man not a child, he can answer what he did, and BECAUSE i know he won\\t I want everyone to know so atleast girls stay safe. Thank you.

317,7.556879991850523e-25,1.0,"Edit: Heads up, this is a bit long and dramatic, I was having a moment. TLDR - Tribute to SNFU and Chi Pig. 

Yo. How’s it? ✊🏻🤞🏻

I’m sitting here stoned off my arse rn and watching SNFU footage all over YouTube. Currently I’m watching the Montréal ‘Chi Cam’ show (fuckin sick btw if you haven’t seen it).

I can’t stop crying straight up. I’m so wrecked about Chi’s passing still, jesus fuck. I’ve never in my life felt true grief over a fallen hero. (That I personally didn’t know.)

I’m a lifelong fan since the 80’s and I’ve seen them at least 7 times over the years and honestly I’ve never seen a mediocre or shitty SNFU show. Like never. They were always over the top high energy and just ridiculously crazy and fuckin TIGHT. They had the consistency of McDonalds restaurants always, even despite a ever revolving member door because those members knew they could never fuck up. Amazing when ya think about it.

I grew up with SNFU as my life soundtrack even in years that I barely listened to them. 

I feel fucking blessed to have witnessed a band that shit hot and original. Completely grateful. Yep, grateful. That’s the word. 

The snowboarding and skateboarding scene in the mid-late ‘90’s was truly incredible in Vancouver (and probably everywhere actually when you think about it.) and SNFU was so intertwined and part of it. 

Ken ‘Chi Pig’ Chinn is a true enigma and he was a gifted writer and and a true showman if there ever was one. Probably one of the best leads of all time. 🐐 A major loss for his family and gigantic friend group, music, his city(s), punk music, the world, and Vancouver. 

Did you ever notice that absolutely everyone has a Chi story? 😂 

I for one will miss seeing that guy around Gastown. He was part of the woodwork.

Anyway. Sorry for being dramatic.

RIP Chi Pig 🐷

A little over a year ago I was invited backstage to meet one of my favorite bands The Descendents at SABROSO 2019 in Dana Point, CA. 
I was invited on short notice just a week before show. I was granted an all access backstage pass. I remember arriving a little late to the show but still grabbed a beer and headed backstage just as Face to Face was on and I got to see the remainder of their set from the stage, after their set I got a picture with Dennis from Face to Face - had a quick chat, cool dude.

I was watching Black Flag set up next and while that was happening I see Mike Vallely next to me - I got a quick chat &amp; handshake with him. Unfortunately, but for good reasons I didn’t get to see any of Black Flags set as I got called offstage to meet none other than The Descendents! The whole band sat down with me &amp; we talked for about 10-15 min, got a photo op with the band &amp; signed setlist.

After the interaction with the Descendents I got a photo op with The Offspring, that was cool too. Also while backstage I see one of the wrestlers in a gold mask who just happens to be none other than Ramses from Nacho Libre. Unfortunately a few months later he passed away, RIP Ramses.

After the photo op with the Offspring and the interaction with Ramses I hurry back on stage as the Descendents are setting up to play next. All I can say is that it was a fucking amazing and an unforgettable experience to watch one of my favorite bands literally right from the stage. The view was amazing, got a guitar pick from Stephen Egerton, another cool souvenir. 

After the Descendents there was a taco eating contest that probably took about 20 min just to set up. While that was happening I see Wee-Man from the corner of my eye walking on stage and without hesitation comes over to me and gives me a fist bump. That was really awesome since I grew up watching Jackass when it originally aired back on MTV. 
Once the taco eating contest started it was intriguing to watch all the contestants stuff tacos in their face. I believe the winner ate about 150 tacos give or take. There was a scary moment when one of the contestants started choking and was given the Heimlich maneuver but was okay. After they were done I got a picture with one of the contestants who also happens to be a Guinness world record holder Takeru Kobayashi. After the taco eating contest was over I also got to watch the Offspring close out the show from the stage. While they played I happen to see singer Deryck Whibley of SUM41 standing next to me, although not a fan it was still cool.

It was an unforgettable experience and I’m thankful for the whole band who took time out of their schedule to sit and talk with me. Also a few weeks later I made it into the recap video of the festival on the Instagram page."
669,1.0926385494913142e-24,1.0,"Punk has always been about fighting authority over personal freedoms and self liberties.  Its messages always brought us a full perspective of the abuse of power enforced over people.  After listening, I always felt good about myself and that I could accomplish things and have my own opinions...it’s all about individualism.  Now, I think punk is losing that.  

This is not only happening with punk rock.  It is something that’s is happening to all types of communication and many are not seeing it.  Instead of pushing the idea of individualism, now I feel it is spreading a monaural sound to have everyone to accept the same ideas.  And if you don’t follow the herd, then you are not punk.  

Though I like some of the new punk bands, for the most part I ignore its lyrics because they are soft.  They focus more on weaknesses and our strengths.  It has deviated the core message that punk rock has always tried to spread to fight authority and be yourself.  Now it’s about fighting the current authority and replacing it with another one.

There is nothing punk about none of this...punk has always been about individualism, but now it has turned itself into a herd of the same thing.  So for me, what I used to call punk is dead."

I still don't get the hype for GG anyway. These same people I know who are GG fans are advocates against abuse, rape, and every other terrible thing you can advocate against. GG was all of those things. He was a rapist, an abuser, beastiality, possible pedophile/hebophile..literally everything bad mixed into one. So its just weird to see these people parade around GG like he's some kickass punk dude when he wasn't punk at all. He was just a terrible person."

I play in a punk band called Crystal Axis and we're from from Nairobi, Kenya. We're pretty much one of the only African punk bands in existence (the whole African punk scene is pretty tiny with few bands coming up over the years. Our metal scene is absolutely huge though! But I digress)

[Crystal Axis music](https://crystalaxis.bandcamp.com)

We have the opportunity to play an amazing punk festival in London this year called Decolonise Fest and it's a big deal for us for many reasons.
Kenya was colonised by Britain so it's pretty poetic that a punk band from Kenya is getting to play a festival called Decolonise. The festival itself is really important for a band like us because Africa is often overlooked when people talk about punk, metal etc it's looked at as a novelty and few people tend to take it seriously. It's kickass that we get a platform to share our music and our message to an audience that we know will take us seriously.

We're fundraising to make his happen (as you can imagine punks in Kenya aren't exactly the wealthiest ever). It would be rad if y'all could take a second to check it out and consider donating to help us make our dreams come true:
[Fundraising link](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/decolonise-crystal-axis?utm_term=8dZjKzWrm)

Literally any amount helps, if we can get enough people to chip in then I know for certain we can bring some Afropunk magic to the UK.

That aside, I'd love to know what you guys think of our music (streaming link in the post but we're also on Spotify, Apple music etc)
And if anyone would like to talk about the African punk/metal/rock scene I'm all ears and I'd love to have that discussion

1754,4.647655034397565e-23,1.0,"I am currently in college for film production. One of my professors has worked as a camera operator and director of photography for about thirty years. Throughout his life, he traveled across the country filming for various employers and he has spend a fair amount of class telling us a lot of stories. One of them involved the band Broken Bones. I do not know exactly when this took place, but I am assuming that it was around the turn of the decade based on what I know about my professor's life.

Basically, Broken Bones were playing a punk festival/event in California. I am pretty sure it was inside a warehouse. It was one of those shows where the band and audience are on the same floor without much separation. As you can imagine, the crowd was going wild, so wild in fact that the cops showed up and tried to break up the festival. My professor did not know why they were there. Unfortunately for the cops, trying to break up a crowd of punks is quite difficult and the two sides broke out fighting. It got to the point where the cops started throwing tear gas into the crowd, causing even more chaos and motivating people to get out of the building. Eventually, it got to the point where there was a fog of tear gas in the building and my professor has to take his camera and leave. While he was doing all that, however, Broken Bones were still playing. I don't recall him ever saying that the say them stop. He had caught the entire show and fight on video, but he was stopped by an officer and had to hand the footage over because he did not have the location release form, therefore had shot the event illegally. I like to imagine that there is a DVD containing that entire show sitting in a vault in some California police station, but in all likelihood it was disposed of.

IDK how interesting this is, but I thought is worth sharing."
1356,8.390137553637922e-23,1.0,"If you aren't aware, or need a refresher, on March 2, 1991, an African American construction worker, Rodney King was filmed by a neighbour through  a window while he was being brutally beaten and shot by a gang of cops while going somewhere on his bike. He survived, but was scarred for life by the events of that morning. The video of his beating quickly spread and became a symbol of police brutality, especially towards minorities.

A legal battle ensued, which ended with the cops that beat him being acquitted.

During the month prior, minorities everywhere were rioting against the cops. They raided stores, set shit on fire, and were basically participating in anarchy (there's a really good Sublime song about the riots  here: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ4q-wQ-w7I](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ4q-wQ-w7I) )

This is bullshit, and it's the same fucking trope that the other side uses to declare their superiority over people who look or act different.

I got into this life because I was young and angry, and this music and it's people were the exact same way.  Unlike my high school, when I walked through the doors of Gilman nobody called me a faggot because I wore a kilt or had a stupid green haircut.  Nobody cared what you looked like, but everyone understood *why* you looked that way.  Society told us how we were supposed to look and act, and we in turn gave society the finger and did whatever the fuck we wanted to do anyway.

Yes, Michael Graves is a piece of shit and a waste of air.  Yes, facism, nazism, ultra-conservatism, all this shit has to go.  But telling someone they can't fight alongside you because they aren't punk enough is just plain fucked, and that makes you no better than them. 

If you want to be on the front lines for what you believe, I say Vive la Resistance!  If you want to get your aggression out in the pit, I'll be there to pick you up and throw you back out there.  Hell, if you just want to listen to pop-punk love songs all day that's your thing and I will make damn-sure that you can listen in peace.

Before this I never thought much about anarchism but now the more I think about it, the more it seems unrealistic due to the fact that it would cause people to go crazy instead of abiding by “natural human rights” like we would want them to. I’ve found that government is necessary, and that ideologies that lack government like Anarchism or Marxism seem like they’d never work in the real world. 

Also this may be very un-punk of me, but I like how Capitalism gives people choice and allows for people (like in the punk scene) to start their own businesses without having to work for someone else. An ideal government for me would involve everybody fulfilling the needs of every other but still allowing for private ownership to fill the wants of people. Not sure if this is even possible or if there is a name for this however."

This relieved me of all the normal anxious feelings I have about how people perceive me. Even the people who gave me dirty looks, I knew why they where and I could just say 'fuck them then'.

Now from what I've read this mostly affects trans and non binary people. However there's a very interesting way we can all resist this bigoted bullshit.

When signing your intake form at the doctor's office when the gender question comes up instead of putting f or m ""accidentally"" put non-binary or ""trans"" 

Now you might be asking ""what would this accomplish?"" Well if we got a ton of people on board with this then bigoted doctors and doctors offices can't refuse trans or nonbinary people as it would cut into their profit margins.

I'm completely aware of all those on brand sites, and I'm looking to buy somewhat cheapish clothes. I just have no idea where to look, for the clothes or DIY materials.

I suppose politically I would be somewhere in the middle. I agree with views and ideas from both the left and right but there are alot of things I don't like about either and both sides lie and use propaganda. Yet there is no political party I agree with.

Well it all came to a head today. I finally told my friends how scared I am. How I'm worried about the struggle I'll have to face to be myself. And to lighten the mood I said ""I know it's not punk rock but I'm really really fucking scared.""

I know that in the mid-90's, and especially in America, punk (as I came to know it) was hugely popular. NOFX, Rancid, all that sort of shit kind of hit the mainstream and skate-punk was the one thing every teen and their dog was listening to. 

But the thing is, we also had the other genres going on too. We had psychobilly, hardcore, street punk, bands that didn't really fit the mainstream but your average skate / pop punk listener would eventually discover. So we got stuff like Swingin' Utters, Dwarves, Snuff, Osker, Son of Sam and all that. Good mix of hard loud music.  


All that shit is DEAD now. 

And it's weird because it's not like there was this huge fucking gap between the 70's and 90's where punk rock disappeared. We still got All, Adicts, Descendents, GOB, Adolescents, Guerilla Biscuits. Punk never died.

Coming back to the genre now (after years of losing interest), those styles of music are fucking obliterated. You'd think the internet would make them easier to find, but nowadays 'Punk' has such a broad meaning that any Spotify playlists claiming to be 'Punk' seem to be full of whiny, acoustic shit or bizarre electronica. Not saying they can't be punk, but all those genres I used to love with the fast thrashy chords and aggressive vocals and 2-minute song lengths are gone. 

Is that it? Is all that good stuff gone or do I just not know where to look anymore? Fat Wreck kind of keeps it alive but their new bands ain't too hot, and all the stuff keeping that scene alive is old bands who have just been in the game for decades."

I don't believe michale graves is a racist or a white supremacist , I believe he was just saying shit to be a prick . I have met him personally and had a conversation with him , and I can vouch that he knows how to articulate his words and his talking points . Anyone who has met the guy along with me , loki , ect knows hes a very nice guy and goes out of his way to meet fans and sign autographs. 
Today on lokis ( michales guitar player ) livestream he addresses the matter and said that michale usually articulates his talking points and that it's odd for him to not give any rhyme or reason to say the stuff he said , he said michale was just saying stuff just to piss people off and be a troll . Hes always nice to interviewers and fans so why would he just alienate his own audience on purpose???? 
I propose a theory that michale graves (ex misfits) was LITERALLY SHITPOSTING on his Instagram just to be a prick , I mean why else would a guy who usually explains why he says things to not explain anything. He really was trying to go out of his way to piss people off and be a prick. Or that's what I think anyway."

Punk is political, no doubt. But this isnt a general news sub, nor is it an organizing sub. So to me it feels like posting these pics is nothing but a receipt of perceived allyship. 

Theyre concert tshirts, ticket stubs, proof you were there.

Its awesome to know that people of all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds are going to the protests. Solidarity is essential.

But can you, just for once, just be proud that you were there? Know that you did what was right for the sake of doing whats right? Do you really need to cheapen it by posting in a music sub saying, ""Look at me! I was in the streets!""

By all means, please, keep going, keep protesting, keep fighting.

Like everyone, the things I was taught at impressionable times in my life helped establish my value system. That value system was challenged by the world around me from as far back as I can remember. 

My reaction has been to withdraw from societal norms into myself. 

The groups of people I’ve felt comfortable around have tended to be punks. It feels my antisocial tendencies have led me to feel more at home in punk culture. It just feels right. The music is urgent and unapologetic and I appreciate those things in music. 


Was it your upbringing, did the music attract you, was it the people you were around, did you come upon the ideology independently and learn to appreciate it, did politics bring you in, or perhaps another activity such as skating, or was it something else entirely? It’d be lovely to discuss. Please feel free chime in.

I hope you are all safe and well in these trying times.

Back then I learned a lot about Punk in places like Iceland, South East Asia or in the post-Soviet countries in Eastern Europe.

Now with a lot of spare time due to Social Isolation I would like to further broaden my perspective. I you would like to tell me about your local Scene and/ or would like to learn about (the History of) Punk in Nothern Germany, just leave me a message!

Any other good reads or ressources about Punk Culture in differnet parts of the World are greatly appreciated as well, of course.

Please do not react to them all at once, but for each one individually (the bands don't belong to each other...and for sure you skip, if you don't want to listen to them). And if you want: Please write down from which country you are.

I honestly don’t even know if he’s severely mentally ill right now, or just super delusional and fucked up. He’s also saying he’s a devoted Christian and is against gay marriage.   Literally all of his songs are about murder, and I highly doubt he follows any of the other Christian rules either.

Hello people of r/punk!
After discovering Yugo-punk, Polish punk, and Turkish punk this February I decided to make a compilation of punk bands from non-english speaking countries (so no US, UK, Canada, Australia, maybe I can a give a pass to New Zealand idk XD). Songs are not necessarily in their own languages, for example KNASH is a Swedish band that sings in English but I love them so much so they're still in the playlist. I'd be super happy if you guys could recommend me bands whose mother tongue isn't English and help me discover different punk scenes. Thanks in advance

PS. I usually don't get enough band recommendations with female leads so I'd really appreciate it if u guys could help me discover more non-english bands with female leads but that isn't necessary if you don't have one in mind."

I've always lived with the ""Us vs. Them"" mentality.

I have very strong personal preferences against both of those ideologies, and feel authoritarianism from either “side” of the political spectrum are both equally as wrong on a fundamental level. Ideas of freedom and telling the people who try to dictate your life to fuck off are what drew me to punk in the first place. Just want to hear some opinions on this and perhaps open a discussion on what I feel is an interesting dichotomy, seeing as both have led to horrible tragedies and loss of life and liberty on a tremendous scale. I understand that the up front anti-semitism, homophobia, racism, etc. of the nazis (especially the modern ones, and I do see this much less in modern communists) draws a divide in people’s minds, but communism had just as much of those within the governments that functioned on it.

I know part of the origin story of Punk was rebelling against the pretentious and overblown bands that where filling arenas at the time, and many of these where progressive rock bands. 

So is there a genre of Punk that has kinda gone back and picked up prog elements? I can kinda feel it a little in like New Wave and Post Punk but I'm also not a musician. I also know that Serj Tankian is a progressive musician and he seems to straddle Metal and Punk as influences of his.    


I know a lot of genres are mirrored in Metal and Punk or even straight up overlap... is there a prog punk genre by that or any other name? 

I know genre omnivores who listen to 'a little bit of everything' might have an easier time figuring out what I'm clumsily asking but still pretty curious."

She found out anyway because she caught my bf rolling a joint in our room, so obviously she got really angry and I wasn't expecting anything different but she surprised me.

She chose her job over me and the person I'm in love with: after she threw away the weed, the papers and the tobacco (which wasn't necessary since it's legal and she knows I used to smoke cigs) she actually threatened me to call the cops on my bf (he's 19) and shouted at me that she could lose her job and that she has arrested people for fewer grams. Then, she said the worst things about him and me and how I care more about weed than her losing her job. She doesn't give a fuck that I smoke it, even if she thinks it's the herb of the devil, she just care about her fucking job and money.
Cops can fuck you over even if it's the person that gave birth to you.

Sorry for the long story but It's an experience I'll never forget and I think it's worth a reading.

(Like my funko pop figures). Is having a subscription to Disney plus frowned upon and not punk? How about the Nintendo Switch I’ve been saving up for?

But it seems like he skipped a few bands that perfectly fit the bill - influential, hardcore or hardcore-adjacent, independently distributed - and it isn't clear why. I'm specifically wondering why Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains and Meat Puppets don't get profiles, given the amount they turn up in other people's stories.

Obviously Azerrad's profiling the groups he feels most passionate about, which is exactly what he should be doing, and I'm not necessarily knocking his choices - I'm just curious why groups like the DKs didn't make the cut. Was the book getting too big? Could he not get interviews? I'd love to know if he's explained his selection anywhere.

PLEASE Do not attempt to find this person. Already some one has been involved that is not the person from the incident. This is only for if you are this person or know her so that you can tell her.  

Ok, story time.September 18th, 2016, I was at Riot Fest in Chicago. I was there, presumably the same as you, to see The Misfits. Early on in the show (even though they were the headliners the sun was still up when this incident happened,) I was in the mosh pit closer to stage left. If I recall the song playing was “Die, Die, My Darling,” but I’m fuzzy on that.   
So there I was, moshing it up, and you got spun out from a pretty wicked hit. You ended up standing somewhat facing me, and your eyes rolled back, you staggered, and collapsed.   
You came close to hitting the ground headfirst and were about to be trampled but I managed to catch you before full impact. You were unconscious and non responsive. I managed to lift you, put you on my shoulder, and get you off the ground. Knowing there was no way I would be able to carry you all the way back out through the pit to emergency services, I carried you towards the stage and fought my way up there all the way to security.   
I handed you over the railing to them screaming to call you an ambulance. They dragged you off past the stage, and that’s the last time I saw you.  
I made a Craigslist Missed Connection about you the next day. Unsurprisingly it didn’t get a response. For some reason I think about you sometimes and that’s why I’m here today.  
I don’t want or deserve any thanks or reward. It’s just for some reason I think every now and then and wonder what happened. Did you get out ok? Find whatever friends you were there with? Get rushed to the hospital? Did you even survive? You looked pretty roughed up and I still have the bloodstain in my jacket.   
Wouldn’t wash out.  
From what I remember about you, because I didn’t get too good of a look and it was close to four years ago now:Short, about 5’3” no taller than 5’5”. I’m 5’9” and there’s no way I could’ve picked up and carried a larger person that far through a mosh pit. I am not that strong.  
Brown hair, shoulder length.  
Hazel eyes.  
I know you had jeans on, and a lower cut band shirt on. I don’t remember what band but I want to say maybe Anti-Flag?  
I just really hope you made it out ok. It was particularly relevant at the time because I’d heard a story about a show that week where a dude got trampled to death in a pit. I just hope you didn’t do the same.  

I decided to add a FAQ section.  
Q:Hey bro you just desperate to get with this girl!A: I’m in a something that I think will be great. Not a relationship at this time but I really enjoy the person I’m talking to.

I'd even go so far as to say I am a huge fan of Lydon and while I rarely agree with all of his opinions and admit he can be kind of abrasive and even a downright dick, he's also incredibly witty, entertaining, and innovative, really changing the course of modern music in PiL. He was also the first to call out the commercialization of his first band and rebel against his manager trying to mold him into a specific image to promote to the youth of the time, going so far as to call it out in PiL's first single, Public Image. I don't think he gets enough credit for that, and I also think it's unfair to slag him for doing things like the butter commercial, as after all, we all need to earn a living.  If nothing else, he's always interesting to listen to even if what he says makes me angry, shocked, amused, or laugh. One thing he never fails to do is make me think. So how about a little love for Lydon in this thread, hmm? Any favorite songs or quotes or stories or just times he made you think?"

These days I travel the world speaking with people about how to choose love (and love yourself), how to live a better way, how to be forgiving, how to accept others, how to have empathy, how to accept all experiences as necessary and educational, spirituality, sexual liberation, fighting for what matters,  standing up for marginalized people, and much more.

This photo is of a flyer from an event I did on the Greek island of Corfu. I decided I wanted to enter Greece by boat so I did. I literally traveled for 12 hours by bus, from Kosovo, to get to the Albanian coast to take a ferry to be able to do this.

Most people don't know much about me even those who know me from back home. I'm a hardcore survivor.

I left Massachusetts and the United States, for very serious reasons, and by getting away I was able to begin to become the man I was born to be.

I've published two books and I'm about to publish three more.

I admit that I'm a hurt person, and I also admit that I know that I'm a walking miracle.

I have no time for bullshit. I survived all I did to do good in the world. Most people who know what happened to me know that I'm an anomaly for surviving.

I have stories and information to share that will both benefit my own life and benefit thousands of others.

If there are people anywhere who are journalists or work in radio or media of any sort, big or small, or have positions of influence, and you want to change the world for the better, get in touch with me if you want to talk. If you want to find out more about the books I published, let me know directly; I would definitely be benefited from the support.

Thank you,  
Craig

When it becomes another stale cartoon

Close-minded self-centered social club

Ideas don't matter, it's who you know""

-Chickenshit Conformist, Dead Kennedys

Punk was founded on individualism and mistrust of authority (this includes right anarchism as well). Now it seems to have been bastardized by auth/lib-left rhetoric.

As a lib-right punk, this makes me feel excluded, we're punks in thought and attitude, and yet we still get scrutiny from our own.

Small rant, but I feel it's necessary."

I was drunk listening to old local bands (suburbs of Chicago) and I realized that our whole scene was heavily supported by this very beautiful couple. 

They owned the house we had shows at.

 They housed a ton of dumb punk kids. Including make rent way to cheap.

They came and supported all the bands even touring. 

They never judged anyone for anything they were doing.

If you asked for help the would pull you up on to your feet.

They are the people I think of when I here ""community builders"". 

What's nuts about it is that they are a traditional Chicago suburbs Christian couple.  
I have seen tons of bands that are still around and even play big venues/fests,  in a basement that should only hold 10 people with like 30 people, because 2 people wanted to see their kids live life well. 
I owe them decades old friends and memories and I could never return the favor. 
So again don't forget the people that support your scene. Let them know that you're appreciative."

I mean, I’m ungodly shy, but I’m slowly starting to get over that... the problem is I don’t know where to go to be exposed to the type of people I wanna make friends with. 
I don’t really feel comfortable publicly stating what city I live in but I will say this about it: it’s in Texas, and it’s moderately sized but still boring as hell. (If you want to know specifically what city PM me, I can tell you privately just not publicly.) It’s so boring because everything here caters to 3 types of people- old people, frat boys/sorority girls, and country boys/girls- and that’s made this stupid town basically punk repellent. There’s absolutely nothing here unless you like bar hopping with frat boys, country music and hunting, football, ugly kitschy stuff with rhinestone crosses and “Southern girl” all over them, or getting flower print old lady dresses and overpriced furniture at antique stores. 
What am I supposed to do?? I’ve seen exactly one guy dressed in punk style at a resale shop, and he approached me and we talked and everything but my introverted ass couldn’t bring myself to ask for his name or phone number or anything. I still think about him sometimes- it’s not even that he was particularly attractive, I could have had my first RL friend in years if I’d just asked one simple question. 
I just want some ideas for places I’m most likely to find my kind of crowd in a place that thinks fishnets are only what you use to catch dinner. Thanks for reading this long post XD"

Ofc it also made me a huge hip hop fan and rage against fan but in terms of punk I don't think anything gave me such a love for punk then this game even though it doesn't have anything to do with punk culture.

The nostalgia I get from going back to those childhood classics I used to listen to, it just gives me a rush of dopamine and i cant stay still even when I'm in public."
654,4.331281012819283e-13,0.9999999999995453,Pop punk isn’t some evil anti punk. It’s just punk that appeals to a wider demographic and that’s fine. Some punks would like to believe that it’s somehow a bad thing because a lot of people like it. I think those punks might want to go to a hospital because they’ve got a five foot long stick shoved up their ass. Punk isn’t some exclusive little club that only you are allowed to be in because you’re so special. Just because a song doesn’t talk about killings cops and dismantling society doesn’t mean it can’t be punk. If a band focuses on sexual frustration or mental illness or abusive relationships then they’re still punk. Also there’s nothing wrong with something that appeals to a lot of people. Don’t act like you’re so damn special that you’re above liking things that everyone else likes.

I've been lidtening to punk for several years, but didn't start really getting into it until I became a high school freshman.  Now that I'm graduating high school, me and some friends decided to take our favorite genre and make band: Punk Face!  There's just one problem...

West Virginia has no punk scene.

We're just four kids from the sticks trying to show the people of Appalachia punk rock.  We want wild gigs with wild fans and to have fun playing music that we enjoy.

Any advice for us?

As to what kind of music we play, it's like a mix of hardcore punk and thrash metal with some elements of country music in the lyrics.  Again, West Virginia, so we're trying to talk about local experiences.  We also occasionally like to make satirical songs making fun of bands like MCR."

I lived in a really prude area before college so it's not like I got my lil crew in hs/ms like it seems everyone else did. I've been trying to get into the scene for 2 years now, but tbh I have no idea what I'm doing and could really use some one to show me what's up. And I mean no clue. I don't even know how to find local bands to listen to and go to shows. 

Bc everyone around me is a hippie if anything, every time I try to talk about pretty much anything even vaguely punk related or play a song in a car with other people, I get shut down. I mean, whatever, they're living they're own life, and I'm not gonna sh-t on them for it. I just want someone who I can have a real, unsensored conversation / jam sesh with.

The punks I do manage to find are more emo/pop punk/metalcore scene. Which is okay, they're chill people, but they still don't really seem like we share interests.

Sorry if this sounds a hella weird thing to ask but I'm really sick of having to censor myself most of the time. 

Tl;dr: How can you find other punks with common interests when you live in a city of hippies?"

I met my roommate at a DIY punk venue called The Hole when we were in high school, around eleven years ago. The entrance to the venue was literally a 3 ft. tall door in an alleyway. It was sick!! But it was ultimately closed down bc of fire regulations. 

On Sunday night, my roommate was arrested for breaking curfew... he was literally dropping off bail money at the bonds office. He had made two previous trips (BOTH after curfew) and was told that he was lawfully breaking curfew and could come back as many times as he wished. In between visits, he was inside at a friend’s apartment near the jail. The third visit, he was arrested. 

It was such a surreal experience to drop off bail money for him across the street from the very venue where we met. Not something I’ll soon forget. 

He has since been released, unharmed. However, he know has an FBI file. Talk about punk cred!! 

But in all seriousness, please stay safe punks. Support one another and amplify the POC voices of your community. Stick together. Fuck the police."

Here's the site:
https://heavyandthebeast.co.ke/

If you have any new music out, or coming out soon, please link me and I'll take a listen, if we dig it either myself or another writer will cover it and share on the site and our socials.

Buying records is stupid expensive, and I need to prioritize. Thought it might be fun to crowdsource a list.

To direct the discussion, I tend to favor classic punk, early post-punk, and early hardcore. The first two I’m after are Wire’s Pink Flag, Minutemen’s Double Nickels on the Dime, and the Replacement’s Sorry Ma.

Sorry I just had to get this off my chest. Also hopefully this will weed out some closeted fascists.

I said “real” concert in the title because I grew up with my pops playing in local bands and had been to more of their shows than I can count. 

My first ever real concert I was 15 and the lineup was Fenix TX, Bad Religion, and Blink 182 at the George amphitheater in Washington state. That show changed my fucking life. I had been playing drums for a few years and had just started playing guitar, and watching those guys fucking rock out was incredible. Being an aspiring drummer/guitarist, I was amazed when they announced that Travis Barker wouldn’t be playing that night (apparently he broke his wrist or something punching some dude who was talking shit about his girlfriend, I don’t remember the details), and that the guitarist from Fenix TX would be filling in for him. And that mother fucker killed it. Being 15 and just getting into music, I was a huge fan of Blink, had been listening to Fenix TX, and had heard a handful of Bad Religion songs. After that show all I wanted to do was play music. And that’s all I did for many years after. Anyway, I’m just rambling now. My point is that show changed my fucking life. 

I have never been on this sub and just read that apparently there’s some bullshit rule about not posting things about Blink 182 or Bad Religion on any day other than Thursdays. Well I give a big punk fuck you and your rules. Delete this post if you really wanna police this shit that hard."

So it was a band that I'm somewhat sure was in the post-hardcore, punk scene of the early 2000's. To describe them, I'd say a lot like Every Time I Die, really fast and constant drums, the vocals were also very uh, yell-y. Not screaming and high but very much yelling. Also no throat-y screaming. But constant drums and really fast like Every Time I Die, but with a more thrash metal style.

The album I listened to a lot I believe was a relatively boring cover, a lot of grey. Also, for sure, the last song had a guest singer. I really really want to think it was In Flames, with that almost fake high-ish growl/scream. I'm sorry I don't know how to describe that style of singing. I tried searching every In Flames song to find this and couldn't, so I may be wrong about who it was. But it was very much that style.

So.... anyone have an idea?"

About me:

I've been into punk since around 1980, which means I grew up during the cold war, when the threat of nuclear attack was very real. (You know that Discharge band you worship? Those lyrics actually mean something.) Maybe partly because of when I grew up, I began studying things like fallout shelters and nuclear survival when I was in junior high.

I am also someone who can be categorized as a prepper. I'm not as concerned about nuclear war as I once was (I do still think about it), but I do think about, plan, and prepare for other situations. 

Prior to this year, I was already increasing my food storage, off-grid communications, and adding to my supply of batteries, medicines, etc. I was more concerned with an economic collapse and supply-chain failure than anything else at that point.

I first became concerned about the possibility of a serious pandemic in January, when I started seeing the news coming from China, and I adjusted my preps to that specific threat.

As a trans woman, the punk scene has been so accepting and welcoming. There have been several subgenres of punk that are literally about empowering women, POC and other minorities. So it's a bit jarring when pop punk songs are mostly about objectifying women

There are so many songs by pop punk bands that are just about objectifying women. As I stated previously, the video for the song Stacy's mom is super problematic. The video depicts a 12-14 year old boy oggling at a grown woman. Not only is this sexist and objectifying to women, but it also normalizes a predatory relationship between a adult woman and a young boy.

That song isn't an isolated incident of sexism. there are so many bands and songs that promote the idea of the ""nice guy"". Descendants, Blink 182, and Fall Out Boy have all had songs portraying this type of person. 

I don't want to be like the cringe SJW type. But I find it weird how a genre that came out of a scene with bands like Bikini Kill could be so inherently sexist."

Preying on young dudes, getting them to come over to his house, getting them black out drunk &amp; giving them drugs (while he stayed sober) and then being molested or raped by him. I also know so many other people who have had experiences of him looking over changing rooms while they're getting changed, jimmy grabbing peoples genitals or even just making gross comments. he was notoriously awful to work for. Theres even a review on the trash facebook from a customer who said that jimmy molested him on his 14th bday in the store. 

Does anyone else have a similar experience? SO MANY people I know who were never affected by him but knew what his did posted on their socials about how sad it was that he died.

What I’m looking for are basically tracks which are:

1. spoken word
2. Deeply Political
3. Extremely incendiary rhetoric
4. Anti religious
5. Lots of good vocabulary, verging on pretentiousness with many obscure words and phrases

Any suggestions would be deeply appreciated. I’m hoping to feel the same way I did when I first heard that track... it gave me chills in how perfectly and poetically it criticized the religion I grew up up, the thing which has harmed me more than anything else on this earth ever has. I think that song really empowered me to stand up for myself in ways that I’d never found the strength to do before.

The only tracks which have ever given me a similar feeling are all black metal tracks, Blood In The River by Zeal and Ardor comes to mind, but I’m hoping to find more tracks like this in the vein of punk."

JJ Bedsore (The Blood) - The amount of piss he sunk and was still able to play as well as he did. His solos aren’t just ‘look at me I’m shredding’, they’re melodic and fit each song. It’s a fuckin hard thing to do when you has a blood/alcohol level of 0.2 whilst recording. 

2.

Johnny Ramone (Ramones) - 99.9% of people are born with bones in their arms and wrists. Not Johnny.... he had a rubber fist. It’s crazy to think the likes of ‘loco live’ or ‘were outta here’ are recorded with just 1 break. The amount of stamina and wrist energy it takes to play that shit isn’t human.

Remember that EVERYTHING you do on the net without countermeasures is trackable to your machine. Your cell phone is a machine BTW. 

You have a few options to not just roll burners like a drug dealer but here's the thing, all of them will get you on a list. That's not a bad thing. In fact you should do these things to protect your privacy from everyone that isn't a state actor. Also, the more people who do it, the less the list matters.

Basic level: Get a good paid VPN.
A good paid VPN does not take logs at all, cross reference this with the country they are incorporated in, and the countries you access servers in. There are a lot of people that go super deep into looking into these services. This is the money expensive way.  Research these providers hard. go 20+ years on them.

Option 2 is self hosting and it's a rabbit hole and a half. Can't explain it to you in a post. Basically it involves recreating your services on a secure network you own. Find the sysadmin that is really down for the fight. It is worth it. If you can get someone to get you to option 2 up and running, that basically gets you to insurgency status."

seems that if we listen to studio prescribed / populalist derived music with a certain cadence and some twee anti-establishment lyrics then we're 'punk'?

Before Inflammable Material was lovingly plonked in front of me I'd been listening to a lot of 70s punk but I was so young at the time that I was only repeating things like 'punk meant something' rather than having really connected with the lyrics and the energy of the recordings on my own terms to make my own mind up.

[This album from '79 serves as a reminder for me how music across all genres can really have a message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nx8adlkvFw) and that integrity and honesty are what really carry a tune at the end of the day.

**What was the album or song (by any artist of any era) where you really got hit by the message punk music was carrying?**  
I always love hearing about people's connections to the music they love so some stories and listening suggestions would be a great discussion for us to kick into!

So Let me introduce myself real quickly; I'm a vintage shirt collector with an appreciation of band shirts. I normally can google pretty much everything but this shirt has kept me up for nights...

It is this Ramones shirt:  
\* Front is the ""Eat at chef Wong's"" print that I also found in a 1977 booklet, the japanese marking spell out ramones which I found by googling japanese vinyl.  
\* Back is a piece of the lyrics from Teenage Lobotomy which was released in 1977 on the Rocket to Russia album.

This long sleeve is definitely not from the 70s, or atleast I guess not.  
It's double stitch and the label was cut out (which makes the search difficult!), no inner tags as well.

If anyone has some information, it would help me out!

Basically me and a friend have been trying to find the name of punk rock band lead singer that had long wavy hair and bangs and was beat to death in a bathroom by their bandmate that had a blonde mohawk while they were both high at an after party. We managed to somewhat narrow it down to having happened in the United States, but aside from that, were having trouble coming up with anything else. Some details may be off as this was purely based off the recollections of said friend.

One other detail that may be a distinguishing factor, the person in question had their face slammed into the sink.

The band they were a part of was fairly small and lesser known apparently.

It's been 9 months since I started doing art and illustration full-time and during this time, I've had the pleasure of working with some fantastic bands from around the world. While it hasn't changed much, the COVID19 outbreak has had some effect on my work. It isn't bad, it's definitely nowhere close to what most full-time musicians, small-business owners or people in the service industry are going through, but I have lost a few jobs. Hence, I wanted to make this post to **invite fresh commissions**.

I'm a pen and ink illustrator from Bangalore (India) and I mostly draw poster art, album covers and such for bands from around the world. I have, in the past, drawn for bands like **Opeth, Anathema, Envy, Mono, A Place To Bury Strangers, Conan, Nadja, Crowhurst, Wang Wen (惘闻), Death By Fungi, Jugaa and so on.** While most of my work revolves around art and illustration, I also take up graphic design work - CD/vinyl/tape layouts, merch mock-ups, press kits, social media adapts and such.

So yeah, if you're someone who could use my art or graphic design skills in any capacity, write to me at **studio@anoopkbhat.in** or just drop me a message here on Reddit. Serious inquiries only, my fees are pretty reasonable. Here's an [Imgur photo album](https://imgur.com/gallery/64NZ0gb) with some of my recent work. For my complete portfolio, you'll have to visit my [website](https://anoopkbhat.in/) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/anoopkbhat). Thank you so much for reading and have a nice day!

He never sold out at all or changed his beliefs despite the band being contentious over them and kicking him out (only to bring him back).

But there are a few verses at the end that I can not figure what do they mean at all. English is not my main language so perhaps it's jargon, I don't know:  


""**For what is a brat** (or prat, can't hear a difference), **what has he got** /

**When he wears hats** and he cannot / 

Say the things he truly feels...""  


I can translate every part of it to my language but it still making no sense at all, who was he refering to? I've read in a community on my language that this part refers to Johnny Rotten, but I highly doubt that, I don't see any signal at all to think that...  


Thanks a lot!"

I guess it's from the 00's. The lyrics  are in English and go a little like this ""i like"" ""something"" you like ""something"". The whole is basically a list of the opposite things the singer likes and what the person he is addressing likes. It s pretty much an attack on the bourgeoisie if I remember correctly. I discovered the artist while watching tracks on Arte. The video of the song should have him going wild on the streets of Berlin with a cast costumed freaks.

Turns out he makes music too, an album called ""Sür Drone"" (98), Torches And Standards (90) w/ with a band Super Session, The Nichemakers (09), and a project called Sock-Tite again with Mike Watt (13/18). 

Alot of it sounds spoken word that he does with backing bands

I can play the acoustic guitar and do vocals.

Any electric guitarists and drummers who'd like to private message me, so we can begin working out the flow and feel of the music, to create something truly awesome, I encourage you to do so. Those who have experience playing hardcore music, or listen to it often, are especially welcome.

Hoping to create heaps of extremely short, extremely fast, chaotic, and violent songs."

The few series following get pretty dark and hardcore, even more so than the film. But if you guys ain't seen it yet, I'd highly recommend the watch! You can find it all on YouTube. And it goes in order (movie first, then the following series)."

They had a sound like no one else at the time and singing about heroin and bondage in the 1960s in my opinion is pretty punk. Granted they didn't have the heavy punk sound  but I definitely consider them pioneers that paved the path for punk rock in the 70's.

You can see it in the 1982 movie Smithereens at 5 mins into the movie, which coincidentally has Richard Hell in it and is a great punk/post punk movie.

The more I listened, I realized this dude has some freaking bars.

Woe -

""All the words in my mouth  
That the scene deemed unworthy of letting out  
Banded together to form a makeshift militia  
And burrowed bloodily through my tongue and my teeth""

The Futile -

""Taste. I have no taste!  
I don't like these tiny portions   
Or your artful abortions of sound!   
Sealed with a kiss, slathered in the sauce sarcastic.   
So go choke on your irony!""

The entire song ""Admit It"". I did not understand anything he was saying when I was younger.

There has to be more. Who has some fuck the system energy and can communicate it intelligently and artistically?"

I'm not gonna include like classic rock or grunge cuz I feel like that's a given for a lot of ppl, but I listen to a bit of rap and some pop, but I used to listen to a LOT of R&amp;B and soul/funk. I guess I listen to a lot, but these r my favorite. Lauren hill and Nina Simone, Al Green, feel good happy sounding music just hits right sometimes!"

It is probably the first time I've found myself really moving my head to punk.

I bought the first cheap bass I could find on Craigslist—this one for $60. The thing was in rough shape, with dirt caked into the fretboard, loose pots/a loose jack, and strings that probably hadn’t been changed in years.

I took the bass apart and tightened up the jack and pots, wiped the whole thing clean, bought new strings and leaned how to set up the bass myself. No custom parts yet, but now I’m in the process of adding stickers to it. Hoping some local shows I want to hit up this summer plus an Anti-Flag show I’m going to next month will provide some good ones.

It was only a few months after Kurt Cobain shot himself and I was depressed af. This is the song (Reeko) that got me into punk rock, I still remember hearing it for the first time. That moment when Reeko explodes from a slow reggae song to some fast paced melodic punk rock still sends the chills through my bones to this day.

Wasteland by Michael Hawkins is a fiction title that collects stories of young punks growing up in a desolate beach town. Full of cynicism and rich story telling, Michael loosely threads these stories together through the theme of general hopelessness.

Anxiety Report by Shane Spiker is a nonfiction title in the same vain as some Henry Rollins work. This covers a year in the life of a traveling behavior analyst and some of the unique experiences that may be associated with other helping professions.

After the success of [my latest video on Hanatarash](https://youtu.be/2YPkRW6ggs8), I am going to begin working on my latest video about the infamous and mysterious Les Rallizes Dénudés.

During my initial research, much of this band is deemed unknown but the rumors, legends and what is known about them is unbelievably fascinating.

I wanted to ask if anyone would be able to provide me with some informative articles, web pages, or anything else they think would be crucial to include in a video about their story, legacy and lore. I've gone through the first couple of articles that pop up, but if there is anything out there that you've seen before that you believe is vital towards the story please let me know!

Ultimately, these Japanese rock bands from the 70's and 80's that sprouted during the birth of punk can be very obscure information wise, so any help at all is hugely appreciated! I want to make sure I do not leave anything out and give the story *(or atleast what is known of it)* of this band justice in video as good as it can possibly be.

-Me

So my band.. isnt a band? It's just me, my guitar and bass, my shitty vocals and a BUNCH of drum loops. I literally run everything off garageband. The reason for this is that no one in my area (a small town in Tennessee) enjoys punk music, or even rock in general. So I just kinda set out on my own.

So my ""band"", Starbomber. I wanted to take classic punk riffs and add pop lyrics over it. And you may think ""but isnt that pop-punk?"". Yes.. kinda. I dont like the ""new"" pop-punk (2010 onwards), so I wanted to make something more in line with classic pop-punk (Buzzcocks, The Undertones, The Jam, etc.).

Anyway yeah. That's my band. I hope you come check us out [(Here)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaVQhOsli60uPIYagxjSZkA)"

He estimates that they played roughly 500 shows, and that they had two albums. They weren’t signed. From what he said they had a decent sized group of kids who would go to their shows , this was vegas in the 90s although they would travel. I know for a fact they played a concert in lake tahoe with the band “The Line” in which my dad was wasted and caused a huge fight. If you listen to the end of the lines song “Be Your Own Reason” you can hear said fight. Has anyone heard of the band? Have you seen them? let me know"

I thought I would give everyone the chance to listen to a fuckin awesome local band in the Seattle area, Neutralboy! . They've been around for 28 years and still makin great punk rock music. They try to tour through out the states as much as they can when all 3 band mates schedules are flexible enough, so you may already know who they are if you're into the local underground punk rock scene.
(Especially if you're in Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota and Utah areas).
So, click the links, sit back, relax and enjoy listening to a great underground local Seattle area band.

Lead singer Mike's solo 'Evil Fucker' music is also online now.

Neutralboy!'s next show is Tuesday the 17th of March at O'Malley's Irish pud 2403 6th ave in Tacoma, Wa.
Their shows are a blast and so are the dudes in the band.

They will also be going on a small tour this April in Colorado.
Details of this tour is on their Facebook page.

Do you consider Television to be 'punk'?

 Joined by the lead singer of Britpop favourites ‘Dodgy’; the legend that is Nigel Clark.

‘Nige’ blasts off stories about forming the cheeky 3-piece, the joy of being a part of the whole Britpop movement and passing up a support slot for Oasis at their legendary concerts at Knebworth in 1996 – a decision which the band don’t regret at all and their reasons for doing it are worthy of a standing ovation.

Nige requests us to tuck into the debut album by American Rock band ‘Television’ entitled ‘Marquee Moon’ which was released in 1977.

TD and WG were up bright and early for this one whilst Nige was kind enough to keep podding until 1am UK time.

A legend and a bloody marvellous chap at that.

Get on it.*Shit Songs Off Great Albums sees Walt Gold &amp; The Dude bring you their meanderings on some of the greatest musical albums of the ages. Along the way, they discuss the artist, the album, what makes it so great, and ultimately, well, the pod show title kind of gives it away…*

I used to be in ska Permission To Fly in SoCal and had a good time in that band till a few of us split off over creative differences. I recently formed a new band Pinata_Partay and am having trouble really gaining traction. We have done a few originals and are currently working on finding musicians and writing more music. Our YouTube is pretty barebones though our Instagram @pinata_partay has most of our info. Anyway, I just wanted some thoughts on the three originals we have done so far. I am the vocalist for two of them and sax player in the other one. Any thoughts would be appreciated, though I definitely can't pull off the vocals for a full concert without killing my voice and I do love sax and ska so we will likely continue to try to do a mix of styles, especially with our drummer who really likes metalcore.

What I do know forsure: it’s an acoustic song, more indie/punk than straight punk, sortof reminded me of pat the bunny.

Additionally, the thing that resonated the most was one verse where a friend of the person singing dropped off his dog/pet, said he was going on vacation. The singer asked if he could come and the friend said it’s not that kind of trip and end up going to kill himself.

Overall, the song is pretty sad but it’s not slow paced. Please help me if you can lol

I searched for it on song search by lyrics tools, on google, on youtube trying to browse suggestions etc... And I found nothing.

Normal: almost sure of the lyrics   
\[...\]: don't remember or can't understand/put it into lyrics

The song is joyfull and motivating, it starts with 3/4 taps on the drums and then ""In the morning when I wake up, I\[...\] {to take up}. \[...\]{staring trough my window}\[...\] a girl I used to knooooooooowwww} \[...\] {make it\[...\] take it}

I thought I would give everyone the chance to listen to a fuckin awesome local band in the Seattle area, Neutralboy! . They've been around for 28 years and still makin great punk rock music. They try to tour through out the states as much as they can when all 3 band mates schedules are flexible enough, so you may already know who they are if you're into the local underground punk rock scene.
(Especially if you're in Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota and Utah areas).
So, click the links, sit back, relax and enjoy listening to a great underground local Seattle area band.

Lead singer Mike's solo 'Evil Fucker' music is also online now.

Neutralboy!'s next show is Tuesday the 17th of March at O'Malley's Irish pud 2403 6th ave in Tacoma, Wa.
Their shows are a blast and so are the dudes in the band.

They will also be going on a small tour this April in Colorado.
Details of this tour is on their Facebook page.

The first being [The Mullets](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4976YDNDuiCx1salf8Yb8f?si=14FeQlNpTHS_HrLS4vWxMA) , I find their lyrics to be smart, funny, and very catchy. Their style, at first listen appears to be the overused pop punk sound, being from 1999, but it seems apparent to me it’s ironic, especially with the lyrics. My favorite album by them, Typical Stereo, is so fun to listen to. Another album, Fork, Knife, Spoon, Shut Up, is hilarious. A big influence on the presentation I give my band. 

Next is [Nice Guys Finish Last](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jdEI7oKs5IXCWRpWZUmJX?si=ii2NK7YDSUKGC78CXabz8w) , they actually share an EP with The Mullets. I love their sound in a completely different way. I’ve always been fond of that DIY garage sound. Certain songs just seem to crumble accidentally and then they all pull together with a heavy hook. Still, with that ironic pop punk sound, they just sound like they’re having fun. Which makes it fun for me to listen to. 

Lastly for this list is [The Farmers](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3jdpu5cIM48XslN90V3Irp?si=qiVtA_xUSVeCHDTM6Ik5jw) , specifically the album, Flames of Love. (Adding that link actually made me see that they recently came out with an album in 2011 that I haven’t heard yet, maybe I’ll give it a listen to day). I came to enjoy their sound during my Violent Femmes phase. Folk punk with lightly played distorted guitar. It actually seems like this album does have any bass guitar. Their songs are very simple, with catchy chorus, and Bruce Springsteen-ish, catchy lyrics. They’re just enjoyable to listen to. 

Tell me your thoughts on these bands if you choose to listen to them, or if you’ve heard of them before and have any information about them!

The quarantine has me going through all my old CDs and I finally got all of these together in one place (but they aren’t organized in any way, that’ll be a later project). These are mostly pop punk and the two columns on the right are mainly compilations. 

I’ve seen about 3/4 of these bands live. I was actually at the Lagwagon Live in A Dive show which was at House of Blues in Hollywood on Sunset Blvd (no longer there). I lived in LA during the late 90s and early 2000s when a lot of these bands were in their heyday, so they’d always be playing the local venues! Great memories. Just thought I’d share"

I used to have an MP3 of it, among other songs, but I cannot for the life of me remember what the band was or any of their other songs - but in my teenage years I loved ‘em.

Think Victory Records style bands. I don’t know if they were ever signed to VR but perhaps that’s how I came across them.

I’m keen to revisit the songs but google is unfruitful. I estimate this would have been in the 00s, maybe 2008-2011.

I guess you need to A) know super obscure bands that likely don’t exist any more and B) know about punk covers of pop songs 🤷🏼‍♂️

According to Wikipedia, Sunset Towns are “all-white municipalities or neighborhoods in the United States that practiced a form of segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation, and violence. Entire sundown counties[1] and sundown suburbs were also created by the same process. The term came from signs posted that ""colored people"" had to leave town by sundown.[2] The practice was not restricted to the southern states, as ""(a)t least until the early 1960s...northern states could be nearly as inhospitable to black travelers as states like Alabama or Georgia.""[3]

They have to care about numbers at some point, otherwise they might get the idea that they can do whatever they want and it will be considered a masterpiece.

I’ll preface this with: I’ve been a diehard fan of TDS since ‘08, I’ve bought all their albums, bought some Merch a few times, and have been to two shows. I love this band.

However, ever since Mother Nature, there’s been a lot, and I mean a lot, of references to drug use and the state that drugs put you in. On Mother Nature, 7 out of 10 songs have multiple drug references, and it’s more than just weed. They just started a record label named “Molly Water Music”, an obvious ode to MDMA. The music and melodies have been stellar, and I enjoy the lyrics and vocals, but its beginning to be a little much. I am praying this next EP isn’t all about drugs and psychedelic states. Maybe i was too young to notice, but RFTS and War Paint were so pure and heartfelt. I feel like i’m alone in this opinion, but I had to just say it. Lastly, AJ frequently posts stories on IG about drugs and smoking. I truly hope he’s doing okay through all this.

Since we are travelling so far, we are planning to go to both the North and South date to make it worthwhile. We don't plan on renting a car because of the young driver fees and we don't feel totally comfortable driving on the opposite side of the road. I did some rough research trying to see flights/buses/trains to get from Leeds to London area. I did not have much luck finding something that would line up with festival times. I am wondering if going to both dates is something a lot of people do/is easily done?

I don’t mean to offend anybody here as I can see how most of the stuff posted here is enjoyable for a lot of people, but a lot of it comes off as cringey to me as well but in a different way. 

Anyways, back to Alkaline. I don’t know what exactly draws me to their music so hard, but I can’t stop listening to them. I love the witty lyrics, dark themes, and Skiba’s (clear/un-modified?) voice. You know how in a lot of pop punk they seem to have a singing style that seems sort of forced? Like an accent? That puts me off to a lot of pop punk that otherwise would appeal to me strongly.

I recorded the song to a cassette from TV around the mid-2000's. I wrote ""Popcorn"" on the cassette label, but I don't know if this is the name of the band or the song. The band looked young, late-teens or early-20s. It was a music video that I found randomly while going through the music section of my cable provider's ""on demand"" service. The video didn't look high budget, but it didn't look like it was shot with someone's camcorder either. So, professionally shot, but limited budget. I've tried Shazamming it and googling lyrics, as well as searching for bands and songs called ""Popcorn"". I've already posted to several subs as well as Yahoo Answers and a few other places, without luck. I'll leave the vocaroo link here (the audio quality is bad, but it's all I've got):

Then don’t get me wrong Enema and Take Off are good but because of how poppy they sound you can really easily overplay all those songs and not wanna hear them again. Self titled has some good tracks but definitely can’t say every single song is good. Neighborhoods was a bit of a let down and anything after that doesn’t count. Cheshire Cat is just really relatable and how sloppy it is makes it the most punk and authentic and least formulaic hence the best. Anyone else agree?

Mest is one of those bands that's been with me most of my life since I was 13 and heard Drawing Board. Self titled will always be my favorite from them but this one could end up being #2. The productions a little flat which is a bummer after they got all the Kickstarter money for a great producer (Cameron Webb) but the songs themselves are great and it's crazy hearing Jer sing again. Dont Worry Son hits esp hard now that I have 2 kids myself. Everythings just coming full circle and it's why I'll always be a pop punker and likely blasting it in the retirement home.

My interpretation is similar to NotNowII’s answer in the old post. When things are going not so
smoothly with your significant other, you have to find some positive energy to lift you back up. I think Jake knows he's ultimately in control of his happiness and no matter what happens he can always be grateful that he has himself and this earth. He is embracing himself as he is and giving thanx back to this earth for providing him a life, almost in a rather Pagan manner.  Quotes like “crawl down on my hands and knees in heartbeat, if i had to” gave me an image of him praising this earth because its “the least” he could do for it. When I first heard this song I definitely interpreted it as failed relationship, but most emo/pop-punk/watever can be compared to that. Overall Jake knows this relationship with the world is going to be tough...with him not being the only one in the relationship with the world...and know that there is ups and downs just like it would be in relationship with a person. 

Let me know what you think. Thank you!"

This would have helped ease the fans into the era instead of doing it in such a sudden fashion.

When I finished college and moved to the city I live in now I was excited at going to many many shows since they happened here so often, but then I remember calculating that since I was 24 I only had about 6 more years of going to shows regularly left! And that's the same amount of time I had been an adult and going to shows regularly at all and kind of panicked. And then I feared only going to about 2-3 a year when some huge band I had been into since did a big tour. Well that didn't happen. I also was worried about going to shows but always being the oldest person there and feeling creepy...also not happening!

It was pretty funny and unexpected because I think of myself going to those early high school and college aged shows and being impressed at the ""really old"" people about 27 who were there. Things changed. Maybe it's a Millennial thing, but I would've expected my older self way back in the day to think I'd be too embarrassed to go see bands like Neck Deep and The Wonder Years (explaining who they were of course and the years they blew up to my younger self lol)...yet I did and I didn't even stand out as the creepy old guy because the age range present was huge and I was well within it. Or that I'd still be going to the type of shows where a bunch of local bands play to a bunch of heavily drinking crowd in some dive bar except now these are often people after the show going home to their spouses and kids (or a babysitter with their kids because they went together) instead of drunk college students going home fearing class hungover the next day. Because I would've never expected it at those college shows.

Anyway it's really awesome and I'm glad I grew up during the age when it would be possible."

Might not reach the highs of Adornment, but I feel like I've listened to it more as a whole. It's just such a good album to throw on and listen to from start to finish. While Adornment touched on serious topics with a more serious sound, I found it so refreshing they still touched on similar topics, but did it with an upbeat sound that it's actually a fun listen. Just don't see it talked about much."

I’m just getting back into listening to pop punk again after way too long away, and I realised after the polls the other day that I haven’t really listened to anything from The Story So Far or The Wonder Years.

I’ll probably get around to most of their stuff eventually, but what would be the big songs and/or albums to really look out for and pay attention to?

Any bands in your mind think are/was very underrated that you think should have definitely went onto be a lot bigger and have more success or that you think they split up way too early and had big potential?

Part 2 of the question. Similar question but just flipped: any bands that you just don’t get? You just don’t understand the fascination with them and how they are actually as big a they are/was?

You can also answer with albums as well if you like. So bands with albums you think don’t get as much love and are pretty underrated and bands with albums you think are very overhyped and don’t see why people like it or that you think is just terrible altogether"

It's a song from the label We Are Triumphant
The advert said that the song was part of the 'Pop Punk Essentials' Spotify playlist made by We Are Triumphant

I've been looking through the playlist and all of We Are Triumphant's YouTube channel and I can't seem to find it. 

The video used in the advert had a lot of orange (basically the video had the band members performing the song with a lot of orange stage lights). Also there were a lot a balloons.

The advert starts with one of the band members (I'm assuming the singer) coughing before (what I'm assuming is) the chorus starts

And some of the lyrics I could make out were
'I just wanted you to know'
'Im not doing fine' (or 'we're not doing fine' something about not doing fine)
'I made it out alive' (or 'I made it out on my own')
'Like I do every time'

And then the ad then shows the cover of the Spotify playlist which is someone (on the right) carrying a skateboard in their left hand with graffiti on the wall to the left and in front of them. 
The words 'pop punk' are in white and then the word 'essentials' is in red. 
And that's all I could really figure out. Can someone help me find the name of the song?"

Hey everyone,  


[https://youtu.be/wnUuyzAcj\_c](https://youtu.be/wnUuyzAcj_c)  


This is a request for some honest feedback \[yes, I really do mean honest\] Don't worry about being 'mean'  


I present a radio show – where during the lockdown I’ve taken on a project to write and record two new songs a week. In all different genres. We are doing 20 songs... so far have done 18 of them.

  
The singer is excellent. This song was a punk song. A genre I love.

  
The singer \[who spent two years in the West End playing a lead in Les Mis, and has done many other shows and high-end singing jobs\] found this the hardest song to do

  
It less than two mins

  
If you have the time, it would be amazing to get some honest feedback. As it was a struggle to record.   


I and the singer have read out \[on my radio show and a followup video\] the best comments for this song. By best I mean all the interesting ones - so maybe I should have said the worst comments \[hmm\]. And so are very happy for brutal comments.  


As well as on my show - this song was also put onto a punk radio stations playlist. But although I love the genre, I  am under no illusions that we are anything but daytrippers.  


The song is about someone believing all the fake news, and going out and acting on it...

  
Feel free to write any reviews/comments,  \[don't worry about leaving 'bad' comments\]. I will respond to them all.    


I wrote the words, music, video. The singer did the melody and singing. Comment on anything - how authentic is sounds, the song, the mix/mastering, the singer, etc..  


We are doing another punk song at the moment... but that is NOT part of our 20 lockdown songs.

  
You can comment here – or better still on the videos YouTube page.

  
Thanks for the help

I'm just wondering how different the album sounds compared to actually being on the floor at the show. I am assuming people who attended the show went and bought the album the following year when it released given it was a live recording of a show they went to.

In the early years of the scene, we had bands like PXNDX, Allison, División Minúscula, and much more. The biggest one of the bunch was PXNDX but they broke up years ago. 

I'd say the biggest pop punk band in México at the moment is Say Ocean. They are like a mix of State Champs and Real Friends.

And she was like a starry night

eyes are glowing to my beating heart

You were as priceless as can be

When you smile, I melt inside

Is it cool if I hold your hand?

Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?

Long hair that blows side to side

You speak and make time stand still

And each time you walk right on by

Do you like my stupid hair?

Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?

I'm too scared of what you think

I'm not worthy for a minute of your time

She's cool, she's my friend

I would wish upon a star

She's all I'm always wanting

she's all I dream

And I want her, need her

Maybe I'll win her heart

By writing this song about her

Honest, let's make this night last forever

Forever and ever, let's make this last forever"

Pretty Odd was a (in retrospect) beautiful album, but imo lacks the iconicry of Fever. Aside from ""Nine In The Afternoon"" and maybe ""Northern Downpour"", there really aren't any songs that truly stand out. V&amp;V was even less than that, as barely anyone truly acknowledges the album as a whole, TWTLTRTD is regarded by many as a bad album (even though i like it), and even though their last two albums, Death of A Bachelor and Pray For The Wicked, went to #1 and even gave Brendon his most successful song, they're just a mess in terms of quality.

For example, Jordan from New Found Glory. I watched Loudwire's ten most improved vocalists and he was on the list. But the song used, ""Hit or Miss"", was done two times. Someone said it was just autotune put to use. If you have software that can separate vocals from a song, you'll be able to hear his voice more clearly and probably hear how much was actually used.

LNOTGY is their best work for sure, but Wishful Thinking and even their EPs had some of the best lyrics. Anybody else feel the same?"

All this is recorded with free software, plugins and guitar amp/cab sims and the tracks are listed in the order they were recorded, hopefully showing improvement in my playing and production. Hopefully this 30-something can still hang playing pop-punk

There's a ton of people in this subreddit trying to make some great pop punk music that people dont really bat an eye to.

      I’ve had this conversation with multiple people &amp; it’s awesome to hear everyone’s opinion on who are the kings of pop punk. I’ll always defend NFG till the end &amp; they aren’t even my favorite band. 

     I could talk about all the records they dropped &amp; how influential they were but I won’t go into that. Imo, they define pop punk. 21 years since there first album dropped &amp; they still haven’t changed from there roots. They never sold out for main stream attraction, just kept on releasing records. That is what I think is so special about them &amp; is something I can’t say about any other band. They kept on releasing the music that they wanted too &amp; did not care what the critics had to to say. When they first came out, they received major criticism with Jordan’s high pitched vocals &amp; that also didn’t stop them.

I'm very out of the game when it comes to genres these days, and how much these genres have shifted over the years. I click on link on this page and these ""pop punk"" bands sound very technical and not stripped-down at all, which makes me worry what I'm doing can not be categorized as such. Thus, just asking for your opinion. Not about the song itself, or whether not it's good or bad. But just if this can even be called ""pop punk"", and if you have a better idea of what I should be calling this. I do appreciate it. And thank you!

While there blues rock sound isn't what most people would consider ""Pop-Punk"", their heartfelt lyrics and scorching, power chord driven songs cement them as a quintessential band of today's ever-changing Pop-Punk landscape. The heart and soul of this band lies with their frontman, Nathan Hardy. Nate brings an unparalleled one-two punch to the equation with his playfully poetic lyrics and unreal guitar prowess. His voice is unlike any other. Slipping effortlessly from high screams to a delicate falsetto, then dancing down to a monsterous growl. 

I'll be the first to say that I'm not a huge fan of their latest release. It's seemingly lacking the charm that previous efforts brought to the table. With that being said, Stovall and Much Love are both marvels of modern rock. You all owe it to yourselves to give these two records a listen.

I hope to use it to have people notice some under appreciated songs in their playlist, or start discussions with people who maybe haven't heard these songs. So, with that said, let's go on to how to play and the rules.
How to play

* Click this link https://bingobaker.com/play/2996933 and generate a board

* Go to your preferred music service, and click shuffle on your favorite playlist

* When a song comes up that matches a space on the bingo board, click on it to mark it off

* When you get a bingo, post your results here, along with the songs you used. If you're feeling up to the challenge (Of writing down every song) you can try to complete the whole board. However, just one line is necessary.

Rules

* Don't add any songs to the queue. The songs used can only be given to you by the RNG gods

* A single song cannot be used for multiple spaces. A single, one-line bingo must use 5 different songs

* Please be legit. Don't just make up results

* Obviously, I can't enforce the rules or prove your validity, but let's all just be honest here and have fun. This isn't a competition

I hope this is something people will actually enjoy, as I think it would be fun to keep track of the songs you listen to, and have discussions with others. I hope we can all have a fun time enjoying music together, especially in times like this. Feel free to send the link to others and play with them. Have fun guys! (Also, I'm not sure if this is pin worthy, but I think it'd be fun if we can get as many people as possible to play) 

Oh, and feel free to suggest spaces you think would be a nice addition. I can edit the board whenever, and it shouldn't be a problem."

Raven uses music to escape her dark reality as she tries to start her life anew, getting a new job and entering into a new same sex relationship; however the adult film industry has taken its toll, leaving her paranoid and mentally, physically and emotionally vulnerable.

Some notes:

1. I did my best to stick to one album per artist; however, I made one exception. 


2. In order to prevent my own bias in determining the seedlings, I tried my best to come up with seeds based on Spotify streams, “best of”/“year-end” type lists, and what fans of the bands tend to consider their favorites. There was no formula for the seedlings other than this, so it was a little bit judgment-based.


3. The brackets are set up by years that so that I could most accurately make some challenging brackets by making each one as hard as possible, since it’s all in good fun. The years are a little bit more biased based on my personal listening habits but I did my best to make the brackets representative of the genre as a whole. 


4. It was tough deciding which albums by some bands to pick.

We had wristbands to go upstairs at some dive bar to the after party. I was a huge fan of Fall Out Boy, Panic! and The Starting Line at this time, so it was fun to hang out with some of the guys.

Some of my memories:

- Kenny Vasoli (lead singer of The Starting Line) was hammered (as was I). This was back in 2005 and I had just got my first cell phone, and had also just started experimenting with alcohol. So whenever I got drunk, I would ask almost anyone I was having a conversation with at the bar for their phone number.

Anyway, I asked Ken for his phone number and he gave it to me. ""Only you can drunk dial me,"" he said. Every now and then I would drunk dial him from that point forward.

- I noticed one of the guys from Panic! getting drunk by himself at the end of the bar. Everyone else at the party was having a good time except for him. I tried talking to him and cheering him up but he was having none of it. Turns out this guy was their bassist who would be fired from the band soon after the tour.

- Pete Wentz was wearing something that looked like a white mink coat, and I was shocked to see how short he was.

I was also a huge Motion City Soundtrack, but none of those guys were at the party, even though they performed that night.

Anyway, I always thought this was a cool story but I never had anyone to share it with. I thought you guys might appreciate it. It was cool to hang out with some of the guys from Panic! and TSL while they were at their peak, and see Pete before FOB became ridiculously huge."

That wasn’t the case whatsoever. Last weekend, I went to a pop punk cover band called “All American Throwbacks” who played in this sweaty/beer/teenage angst filled tiny room in Joliet, IL. The floors were sticky. I could feel the sweat from the band. It was so surreal. 

These 3 dudes played their hearts out. They had just such a great time. They were drinking, having a fun time, fucking with the audience, and overall, enjoying their fucking night. There were only a good 10-20 people in that room, but we all were having the time of our lives. We were singing along Blink-182 songs and moshing away. The band made it their own version: they added new lyrics and sped up rather slow Blink songs. They covered everyone from Yellowcard to Green Day to Blink and Lustra. They had their own sound. They had so much energy. They somehow made such a small room feel so full. 

They closed things out with a Blink song. The audience wasn’t having it. We all chanted “Scotty doesn’t know”. I’m not sure if the band knew how to play it, they looked a tad bit panicked (they could have been just fucking with us). We kept chanting. They absolutely killed it. They had fun with it. I lost my voice singing along. I questioned the structural integrity of that building, that’s how fucking dope it was!

As someone that enjoys the punk and post-hardcore crossovers and flavours of pop punk, I'd rather it wasn't the case, but bands developing their sound isn't unexpected.

With that being said, goddamn. Do we have to jerk off the same 6 artists every single day? I love being able to scroll through the new posts to check out new and upcoming artists who are contributing to the pop punk zeitgeist in refreshing and inspiring ways, it just energizes me. But I swear every single time these new artists who are genuinely talented are never listened to or upvoted for others to see because there will always be someone posting some The Story So Far song, or some throwback to MCR or Fall Out Boy (and don't get me wrong, I love them too). 

I guess this is just a friendly reminder to step outside of your comfort zone in this community and see what new music is out there for us all to enjoy. I feel like we like pop punk because of the genuine raw emotion, angst, and clarity it can convey. And the depth of those feelings can't all be expressed by the same popular artists that are upvoted so intensely time and time again. So I'm going to try harder to check out what you all are posting in the new section, and giving all those artists you come across the time they deserve to be heard. I hope some of you will challenge yourself to do the same."

Since many of us are locked in our homes, it's time to start exploring new artists! I'd love it if you checked out some of the pop-punk projects I've been working on. Musically, it's heavily influenced by classic pop-punk like blink-182 and Green Day. Lyrically it's closer to the Wonder Years. There are some modern pop influences in there as well. I listen to a lot of Post Malone, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish.

Would love for you to check out a couple of the tracks and let me know what you think.

Here’s what I can remember:

It would’ve come out some time between 2010-2015.

The style was like a pop-rock/punk band, I actually think it was kinda like an All Time Low feel, it was definitely generic at the time (probably why I’m struggling to find them) but they had some good tracks on this album.

The album cover was blue, I think it was the sky but I could be wrong.

The biggest annoyance is that I’m sure that the album name and the song names were really long names. I also feel that the opening track was the title track, either that or the long name of the title track was the chorus lyric.

It was always in the first third of my iPod list, meaning either the band name or the album name is in the first 1/3rd of the alphabet.

I have a feeling that the band name was around 3 words long. 

I don’t *think* that they did much after this album, so they may not be putting out music currently.
Could be wrong though. 


Any help would be appreciated! Every year when the sun comes out I think of this band and I just don’t have enough information to find who they are and listen to them again.

TLDR ; Got some major nostalgia blue-balls, help me decipher this band/album."

3356,1.0,6.5729946507712826e-21,"Pop Punk isn't doing so well. The good bands have risen to the top and the mediocre bands fell off or broke up. We pretty much know who will stick around. The Wonder Years, The Story So Far, Four Year Strong, Knuckle Puck, and maybe a few others are all that's left from the Late 2000s - early 2010s era. That's the era I'm most familiar with and the scene I was a part of. 

But, I think if any band had the potential to revitalize this genre its gotta be Belmont. Their new singles show some wild creativity. Pop Punk with breakdowns certainly isn't cool anymore but they're doing it and doing it very well. 

What do you guys think? Who else is our best hope?"
2361,1.0,7.8855813108474e-44,"Bring out the Dickies Shorts, spike up your hair, and find your favorite home in Enema of the State, for I’m delving into the golden era of pop punk!
Everyone already knows it. With breakout-to-mainstream-in-no-time bands like Blink 182 and Enema of the State in ‘98 cementing itself in music history, and Drive Thru’s New Found Glory, who don’t even need an introduction to their influence (considering two influential pop punk bands named theirs after song lyrics or titles by NFG), the genre personified arrested development in youth and harnessed the fear of the unknown with reminiscent but hopeful chords and melodies that we can relate to and find a home in almost instantly, even if you’ve grown up in that era and you’re in your 30s now. The culture around this genre was palpable and spanned the planet for a time, but by nature, an onslaught of fantastic bands just couldn’t gain the traction of their influences/peers. 
I think my favorite example is another Drive Thru special named The Starting Line, specifically their debut “Say It Like You Mean It.” The band started as a good old “vocalist wanted” ad in a record store in ‘98 and the rest was history after Kenny Vasoli came to play. A year after their debut EP was released they instantly were scooped up by Drive Thru and SILYMI was released just over a year later.
But it just didn’t take off. It never even reached Gold certification. Their breakout single “The Best of Me” was a regular sight on MTV’s massively popular Music channel for a time but just didn’t have the fanfare of Blink, NFG, Simple Plan, and Sum 41, and although a fantastic tune, it’s, in my opinion, one of the worst representations of the rest of the music on this album.
While it can likely be attributed simply to a naturally-oversaturated genre, loads of unique personality and massive, massive dedication is required to get there and stay there. 
And that’s a shame because SILYMI is a top 10 album of mine that outshines so many other albums in this era in every way.
Jam packed with clever, reminiscent, heartfelt lyrics and genuinely positive content, juxtaposed against slamming guitar intros, riffs, and instrumentals that aren’t afraid to experiment or take their time delivering atmosphere, they also toss in touches of hardcore influence and screams in songs like “A Goodnight’s Sleep,” “Cheek to Cheek.” They used a well-known blueprint, taking plenty of influences from Blink and Green Day, but what resulted was less of a surface-level, summertime pop punk banger album and a more somber, emotionally-aware derivative that wasn’t afraid to lay in on emotion and their influences from the emo and post-hardcore genres. If you’re a fan of pop punk/emo, take the time to listen to this album. Whether it’s their hopelessly hopeful “Up and Go,” their searing “Cheek to Cheek” (wait until 0:40 if the song isn’t your cup of tea), or their obnoxiously catchy “Decisions, Decisions” that features cowbell... I think you’ll all find something to love here. 
Let me know what you think, and what else is super underrated from this era do you think?"

I've been going through a nostalgia trip of Neck Deep videos for the past hour or so and felt inspired to make this post. Coming from someone who discovered the band between A History of Bad Decisions and Wishful Thinking, I naturally sometimes find myself missing that original sound that hooked me on the band. One thing that I was instantly hit with is the realization that Rain in July is... not very good in retrospect lol. The nostalgia is there but man those tracks are nothing compared to the amazing songs they went on to write. I honestly think that no matter what they do with their sound, they consistently write better and better songs with each era. Watching them grow has been a treat. I know a lot of people aren't finding enjoyment out of the new singles, and to be honest I was taken back by the direction at first too. But as I commented on another post earlier, once I accepted that this is their direction I was able to find the enjoyment in it and I love all the songs they've put out so far (especially I Revolve and Sick Joke). Just wanted to express some love and share my excitement. If Life's Not Out to Get You was Neck Deep's Enema of the State, then All Distortions Are Intentional could potentially be their Untitled (remember people didn't like that album at first either)."
2582,1.0,1.0040595065829934e-29,"I found this pretty interesting... Does anybody remember Hawk Nelson from back in the day? They had (what I think are) two really great pop-punk records come out: Letters To The President (2003) and Smile, It's the End of the World (2006). I was 13 and 16 when they came out so maybe me being young had something to do with me liking them more because they were pretty polarizing for being one of those Christian bands that's not, but definitely is. You know what I mean? Like, ""We're not a Christian band; we're Christians in a band,"" like MxPx or Five Iron Frenzy. So that meant the punk scene didn't always like them because they were too Christian and the Christian scene didn't always like them because they were too punk... 

Anyway, I liked those two albums even though i look back at them now as the poor man's MxPx. Well they put out five records total from 2003 up until 2013 as the pop punk group and then frontman Jason Dunn left the band, the guitarist Jon Steingard was moved up from lead guitars to frontman and they rebranded a contemporary CCM (Christian contemporary) group. It was so strange, but by the time they did that I had long quit listening. I remember giving their third and fourth album each a listen and being underwhelmed. I still dig those first two. If nothing more, they're nostalgic.

Which brings me to why I'm posting and wondering if any of you know anything about any of this. I remember Jason leaving so abruptly and couldn't tell if it was actually amicable or if it was just positive ""don't burn bridges"" PR from both sides... I just remembered all of this for some reason and tried to do some digging and can't find anything. Jason doesn't follow any of the original members or new members of Hawk Nelson on Instagram and none of them follow him. Even more bizarre considering that I know Daniel Biro, the bassist and only original member left, was a groomsman in Jason's first wedding and Jason was one in his. I just find that so odd and wonder if any of you remember any of this or have any info."

 It’s official: My Chemical Romance is back, and they’re heading out on their first tour across North America in nine years.

The emo-rock group, which split in 2013, announced that they would reunite this past fall. They returned to the stage for a sold-out show at the Shrine Expo in Los Angeles, followed by previously-announced gigs in the UK. Now, they’re slated to return to the states with a tour kicking-off on September 9 in Detroit, Michigan. From there, they’ll visit Toronto, Atlanta, Houston, and Denver, making appearances along the way at arenas like Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, TD Garden in Boston, the Tacoma Dome in Washington, and The Forum in Los Angeles. Las Vegas will round-out the trek on October 11 at the T-Mobile Arena.

My Chemical Romance announced the tour with a short film dubbed “A summoning…” The video features music from band members Ray Toro and James Muhoberac while a young boy tries to outrun three masked figures.

2198,1.0,2.7394487679038205e-22,"They have literally ALWAYS followed popular trends. In the mid-2000s, emo-esque rock was mainstream. So Pete Wentz put on eyeliner and they did that. When that started to fade, they made a much more pop-infused rock record in Folie (their best album imo). Then after the hiatus they followed the trends of what pop rock is today. They've always been trend followers, but that doesn't diminish their music at all. A lot of people on this sub just happen to enjoy older trends more than newer ones, so they see Fall Out Boy as sellouts who hopped on the pop bandwagon. Truth is they've been mainstays there since From Under the Cork Tree. 

So those of you calling Fall Out Boy a pop band just following what's popular, just understand that they've always been that way, and they do it really really well. I can guarantee that if the radio in 2005 sounded like it does today, Fall Out Boy's old music would've been a lot different. Again, I don't think this is a bad thing, since they've consistently taken trends and made solid to great albums out of them. They're my favorite band. I think they've done a good job at maintaining their integrity and respect through it all. But if you think them following current trends in music is a new thing, then you're misinformed. 

I'll admit that they were probably a bit better at following the trends of the 2000s, but if you don't think their last three albums have some gems on them, I don't know what to tell you. Fall Out Boy has always followed trends, but they're damn good at what they do."

3407,1.0,4.362184590130219e-21,"I was IP blocked by Ticketmaster/Live Nation since January 1st (block still in effect) for buying, from the Philippines, 10 Knuckle Puck tickets, each ticket being for a different place and date (because I love Knuckle Puck). I found out that I was blocked after my Live Nation app announced All Time Low in Western Pennsylvania February 1 and I wanted a ticket. Following the realization I was blocked, I contacted Ticketmaster 4 times in January, stating my problem and IP address, but I'm still blocked.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, after the MCR controversy, I became curious about Ticketmaster and my curiosity paid off: found a 2 year old news article that exposes the complicity of Ticketmaster in resale, directly violating its TOS (at the time).

3373,1.0,1.8213658074485396e-18,"Do you have any opinions that over the years have completely changed? Here’s some of mine as examples:

For the most part I couldn’t stand Neighborhoods (the Blink album) and I thought it was pretty terrible and I had tried it a good few times until about 4 months ago I decided to stick it on just to see if my mind had changed and now I really like it apart from Wishing Well that I still think is awful. California is an album that I liked instantly i always stuck for it for when people would say how bad it was but recently I listened to it in full again and don’t get me wrong I still like it but it’s gone way down in terms of where I’d rank it among my favourite albums by them  

I kept hearing about Transit as a lot of bands I love and follow on social media was talking about them when they split up and I’d had never heard of them before and I thought as loads of bands was tweeting about them I’d give them a go. I like to try things a few times at different points when I can’t instantly get into it  and I tried Transit a fair few times and I just didn’t get them and they did nothing for me and then about 6 months later a song randomly came on Spotify (some random playlist) and I was hooked ever since then and now I love them

About 2-3 years ago I was massively into Knuckle Puck, I couldn’t get enough of them and I thought they was destined to blow up and be the next big thing in the scene and for whatever reason I stopped listening to them and about a year ago I put them on for the first time in at least 5 months (maybe more) and my mind just changed instantly. I can’t tell you for the life of me what it was but I just thought to myself “why did I ever like this band” and now I think they are awful and I can’t listen to them"

3233,1.0,5.828344793941032e-22,"I've seen a lot of comments about how new Neck Deep songs aren't as good as LNOTGY or about how TPATP isn't as good and doesn't live up to it etc. But I don't think Neck Deep is trying to sound anything like LNOTGY because if you look at that album from an unbiased standpoint it's one of the absolute best generic pop punk albums ever written. They caught lightning in a bottle with that album. IMO it is up there with early Blink and Green Day albums that defined the genre. If Neck Deep tried to write songs and albums to replicate LNOTGY every comment would instead be ""this is good but LNOTGY is still better"". So stop comparing everything they put out to something that most likely will never on be replicated."

 The iconic pop-punk groups New Found Glory and Simple Plan are joining forces this summer for a co-headlining trek.

“It’s finally happening!!” Simple Plan said in a statement. “It took almost 20 years, but we are really stoked to announce that we are heading out on tour this summer with our friends New Found Glory on the “Pop Punk’s Still Not Dead Tour”! This is the first time we’ve ever toured together and we can’t wait! We’ll be playing all over the US and bringing Knuckle Puck as our special guests so you know it’s gonna be RAD!”

The “Pop Punk’s Still Not Dead Tour” kicks-off in St. Petersburg, Florida on May 29, followed by shows in Silver Spring, Atlanta, Cleveland, and Chicago. Along the way, they’ll make stops at smaller venues like New York City’s Rooftop at Pier 17, the House of Blues Boston, Denver’s Mission Ballroom, and the UC Theater in Berkeley before[(read more.....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/02/new-found-glory-simple-plan-tour/)"

Hi Everyone,

We're writing to inform you that unfortunately Bayside's upcoming tour has been cancelled. You can find a statement from the band below.

""*We’re unspeakably bummed to have to announce the cancellation of our 20 Years of Bad Luck tour. This tour was meant to be a celebration of 20 years as a band and we wanted so badly to spend it with all of you but the world had other plans. We worked very hard at rebooking the entire tour for later in the summer but it became clear, even before announcing, that our postponed dates weren’t going to be possible either.*   
*We plan now to rebook the tour for some time next year. We’re making this decision because we just don’t know when it will be okay to tour again and if we “cancel” then people can get refunds.*  
   
*This was on pace to be the most fun as well as the most successful tour we’ve ever done so this really breaks our hearts as we’re sure it breaks yours. We promise you that we will make this happen at some point and we hope that when we can, you’ll join us. Please stay safe and sane.*  
*-Anthony, Chris, Jack and Nick*""

We will issuing refunds minus CC services fees incurred for all purchases over the next three weeks to the card used while purchasing. Nothing needs to be done on your behalf for this refund.

We apologize about the inconvenience and hope everyone stays safe.

Thanks,  
   
Shofetti and Bayside

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

kinda bs if they withhold some of the refund due to cc fees."

Thank you. They were already in the previous bracket. Try to list only bands that became popular in 2010-2019. I know it's hard not to list bands like Green Day, Blink-182, and All Time Low. However, we already had a bracket that listed these amazing bands. I want to find who is popular now. The bands listed all had their day. Let's respect the bands that are popular now for how incredible they are."

I already listen to The Wonder Years, Real Friends, Have Mercy, Hot Mulligan, Hotel Books, The Hotelier, Foreworks, Neck Deep, Daisy Head, Kayak Jones, and ETC.. all of your pop punk sad boi basics and shit everyone should know of.. j"
3596,1.0,2.965833606210665e-38," Alright, so I finished my Taylor Jardine fan fiction. Before you all go and talk shit about band fan fiction, you have to acknowledge mine is way better than all those other wannabes. Check it out.  
There I stood alone in the cold. It was about 45 minutes after the We Are The In Crowd 2014 reunion tour show in Toronto. I had an awesome time.  
All of the bands were amazing and Tay was looking extra sexy tonight in her cute pink Paramore tee. I knew it probably wasn't the best weather to be standing around in, with it being February in Canada, but luckily I was bundled up with my TSSF crewneck underneath my winter jacket and my cozy Attila pants. I was so determined on meeting Tay that nothing else really mattered that night.  
""You're not going to see her, just give it up"", my friend told me before he left to go back to the hotel.  
""No, I have to stay, this means alot to me"", I told him.  
I began to think that maybe my friend was right and that I was just wasting my time until I saw a small girl from the distance as she walked toward me.  
""That can't be Tay, can it?"", I thought to myself.  
She got a bit closer and I realized it was her. Her wavy brown hair, her beautiful eyes, her sexy curves which were distinguishable even in her winter attire. My heart started to beat faster in my chest and I started to feel a bit jittery.  
""Hey I'm sorry about this but can I use your phone?"" She asked. ""Mine just died and I have to make an important call. Were you at the show""?  
It took me a couple seconds to process what was happening and I muttered out a soft ""Yeah.""  
I quickly pulled myself together and then blurted out ""it's so nice to meet you, I'm such a big fan, this is truly an honor"".  
She blushed and said ""thanks man!"" in her unbearably cute tone.  
I said to her ""before you use my phone, can I have a picture with you though?""  
She said ""sure!"".  
I was like ""sweet, now I'll have a picture with the two cutest pop-rock singers, you and Jenna from Tonight Alive!"".  
""Well, I'm not too sure I could compete with Jenna"", she said.  
""I've always preferred brunettes actually"", I said back to her.  
She giggled and smiled. I reached into my pocket to pull out my phone out and watched my dreams shatter before my eyes as I realized that my phone battery had died.  
I blurted out ""Oh man!"".  
She was like ""what's wrong?"".  
""My phone's dead"", I said.  
She said, ""I'll tell you what. Come onto my bus and we'll charge both our phones and you can take that picture with me"".  
I responded ""really? you'd take me on your bus?""  
She said, ""sure thing, it's the least I can do for a fan who waited 45 minutes in the cold to meet me"".  
My face lit up with excitement.  
We walked a couple of blocks until we got to her bus.  
As we walked inside, I was surprised to find out that the bus was empty.  
""Where's the rest of the band?"" I asked.  
""Oh they went to go hang out with Set It Off."" she said.  
""That's cool"", I responded.  
We sat down next to each other on one of the couches and she started to scoot closer to me.  
""Shouldn't you be finding your charger?"" I asked.  
""I just remembered that Jordan has it"", she responded.  
I said ""oh that's cool, so now what?"".  
She leaned in closer. My heart started to beat fast. I began to get sweaty in the palms.  
""Don't be so nervous"", she said as she leaned in to give me a kiss.  
I kissed her and then I immediately pulled back.  
""Do you have a boyfriend?"" I asked.  
""Sort of. Things are complicated"", she responded.  
""That doesn't sound too good"", I said.  
""Kiss me again"", she whispered in my ear.  
""Kiss me again... like the We Are The In Crowd Song?"", I asked.  
We both laughed.  
""You're such a dork"", she said.  
Suddenly I hear a loud noise as someone entered the tour bus. I begin to panic and then I see that it's Derek from State Champs, one of the opening bands on the tour.  
""Derek, what's up man?"", I said, ""awesome set tonight"".  
""What the fuck are you doing with my girlfriend?"" he asked me in an angry tone.  
I said ""Huh? Taylor is your girlfriend? I had no idea"".  
""Yeah"", he said, ""and you've got your hands all over her"".  
""Slow down buddy, she came onto me"", I said in defense.  
""She came onto you? Why the fuck would she want you? You're just some dumb fanboy. I'm the lead vocalist for one of the best up and coming crewneckcore bands."" he responded aggressively.  
""Calm down man. Look, I've got alot of respect for you. The Finer Things was in heavy rotation on my iPod last November. I don't want any conflict"".  
""Derek, I have something to tell you"", Taylor quickly budded in.  
""What?"", he asked.  
""This is what I was going to tell you over the phone if Jordan hadn't taken my charger but I'll just say it to your face... we're through"".  
""What?! You're breaking up with me? Why?"" he responded, sounding upset and confused.  
""I read about that stuff you did with that girl on the internet"", Taylor said.  
""But baby, that wasn't real, it was fan fiction"", he told her.  
""I don't care, we're done."" she said.  
""Fucking fangirls"", Derek muttered to himself as he walked off the bus."

We have been running a book club for rock albums for 4 months, where we take 3 rock related albums a week (1 voted on by users, 1 chosen at random from user submissions, and 1 chosen by a member of staff) and we listen/discuss/rate them as a group. We only review rock but we all have additional interests and there is more and more cross over work being done. We are in week 17 now and have around 70 members currently. This week we are doing only monthly new album week (theme 2016 to now) with artists Benjamin Booker, Good Tiger, and David Bowie. In the past have reviewed albums from Soundgarden, Jethro Tull, Kaleo, Mastodon, and Green Day to name a few. We have members from all over the world of varied ages, sexes, beliefs and backgrounds. We don't all like the same rock but even those who are more picky have found new music to enjoy. We talk about the weirdest metal to the most light of pop rock songs.
If this sounds like something you would enjoy, we welcome you to follow this link. Just read and agree to the rules when you join then enjoy. https://discord.gg/UZbySAd"

3592,1.0,7.545138544906923e-32,"Hi everyone! My name is Emma, and I’m a fourth-year sociology student at St. Thomas University in New Brunswick, Canada, writing my undergraduate thesis on female pop punk fans. I’m looking for 5-7 participants to respond to some questions about their experience as female fans of the genre.

Important information and format: My research is about younger female fans of the genre, so I’d prefer participants who are between 16 to 25 years old. However, you do not have to publicly share your age to be involved. All data will be collected, transcribed, and analyzed by me for my thesis as well as being shared with my thesis advisors and committee. However, after the deadline for the end of study passes, I will remove this post. 

In order to stay within my university’s ethics guidelines, your responses can’t be publicly posted on Reddit. Therefore, if you want to participate, please send me a PM and I will send you the questions. There are 14 questions, some of which are just general demographic information and most of which are about your experience as fans of this genre, what you like about this music, what draws you to it, etc. However, you don’t have to answer every single question if you don’t want to or you feel your answers are getting repetitive or something. You don’t have to answer them immediately, but because I have a deadline for when I have to complete my thesis, I would prefer if you answered them within a week so that I can get started on writing (however, I understand that stuff comes up and if you need more time that’s totally fine).

You can withdraw at any time by sending me a message saying that you want to withdraw. As well, if you change your mind about participating and want to have your data withdrawn from my study after you have completed the questions, please PM me before March 1st, 2020, as that is when I am aiming to have the first draft of my thesis completed. After April 1st, 2020, I cannot remove data from the thesis as it will be published by that point.

The purpose of the thesis is to study why female fans enjoy this genre of music, so I don’t anticipate any serious topics coming up in the discussion questions, however, if you feel uncomfortable with the questions being asked or if serious topics come up and you do not want to continue discussing them, feel free to withdraw.  The benefits of participating in this study are that you’ll have the ability to contribute to sociological research (and help me graduate!) and have your say about your opinions on this genre of music, why you like it, and your experiences!

What will happen to your answers: The data obtained from your answers will be transcribed, analyzed, and published in my completed thesis in April 2020. I will also be presenting my research as a research fair in March 2020. There will be no identifying information, and there is no obligation to share your name, age, hometown, or anything that could identify you, and I will never at any point have access to any of that kind of information. If you are interested in reading the completed thesis and seeing my conclusions, feel free to ask me. I’ll gladly send you a copy when it’s finished!

If you’re interested, please PM me and I’ll send you the questions! If you have any questions about anything I said in this post, feel free to comment directly on this post (it’s only the actual questions and your responses that can’t be made public according to the ethics guidelines) however you can also send a PM with your questions. Thanks everyone!"
2797,1.0,7.198651064760491e-19,"Posted in r/audioengineering and r/Guitar but I figured ya'll might be able to help too.

Heyo! I'm working on two EP's to release over the course of the next few months, and I was wondering if anybody has any tips for recording and mixing pop punk guitars. My music is mainly a mix of alternative and hip hop, but I want to make a few pop punk songs so that I can bring in a full band live and really hit all my favorite genres.

I'm recording with a Fender Tele, not 100% sure what pickups are in it because its brand new and my father just bought it. I also have a Schecter with EMG's in it that I could use. I'm recording into Ableton Live 10 through my Scarlett Studio, and am running Guitar Rig 5 and BIAS FX.

I'm looking for a tone similar to Knuckle Puck, The Home Team, A Day To Remember, The Story So Far, WVNDER, etc.

Any tips on mixing? What amps I should use, and what settings? I'm open to anything, I'm really trying to make a solid project that sounds good on the ears."

2705,1.0,8.361543131010649e-55,"I don’t know if this is because other genres haven’t seen as many bigger releases this year that are personally on my radar to compare to but I feel like this year has already been amazing for rock. Last year my entire top 5 for AOTY consisted of pop albums. So far this year 10 (or 9) of my top 12 is some form of rock music. Releases such as Boston Manor, Spanish Love Songs, and Polaris are masterpieces meanwhile there have been a ton of really good rock albums to pad the deck. Lots of amazing scene albums and even albums in other rock genres just continue to amaze me this year. 

For example 10 of my top 12 albums of 2020 at the moment consists of Spanish Love Songs, Boston Manor, Polaris, Tame Impala, Brian Fallon, 5SOS, Handguns, Hot Mulligan, Four Year Strong, and Slotface. 

On top of my personal list there have been other great releases such as The Amity Affliction, Dance Gavin Dance, Trivium, Silverstein, Code Orange, All Time Low, Dead Lakes and more. Plus we have a lot to look forward to with Broadside, Don Broco, Everytime I Die, McCafferty,, Metro Station, Neck Deep, State Champs, Simple Plan, Less Than Jake, Angels and Airwaves, A Day to Remember, Emery, The 1975, Pierce the Veil, Super Whatever, The Ghost Inside and more.

I’m struggling to recall a recent year with this much good rock music. The year that keeps popping into my mind is 2014 for some reason but I can’t even recall exactly which albums were exactly 2014.

What do you guys feel about the state of rock music this year so far? How does it compare to other recent years in your mind?"

It almost definitely is from one of the following bands:

All Time Low
Fall Out Boy
Good Charlotte
New Found Glory

It’s driving me nuts, hope you can help."
1990,1.0,8.127279897880297e-15,"Hey everyone I need some help and I'm having trouble finding certain songs and I don't know what to put into google. I love songs with these kind of lyrics and themes below because I can relate a lot to them and it's one of the many great things I love about this amazing genre. Thanks so much if you find any. 

Here's what I'm looking for 

Songs with lyrics about mundane life, having no job, having no life, the simple things in life. I'll put some song titles below with these themes in case that may help you with what I'm looking for. 

Sum 41 - Motivation 
Neck Deep - Telling Stories

Lurk was a lot better than i expected. Grayscale was the most stagnant show i have been to in a long time, is this typical for them? Dont get me wrong they sounded sharp, but there was so little energy and so little shit to grab you, every sounded mostly the same to me except the slow songs and atlantic."

3563,1.0,1.7645111759665057e-18,"Hey, I posted recently about an upcoming emo-musical film which I am producing, and there was some interest in the project. 

The film uses music in the style of Neck Deep, Blink-182 and Paramore, as well as heavier groups such as Bring Me The Horizon, A Day To Remember, and I Prevail. We are working with musicians from around the world to help create the music for the film, and this is a major collaborative effort.

&amp;#x200B;

 For those who didn't see, the plot is as follows:

&gt;The film follows the story of Raven, a failed Broadway actress turned amateur adult film star who attempts to leave the industry and move back home. However, her family believe she made it big in America, forcing her to live a lie.  
&gt;  
&gt;Raven uses music to escape her dark reality as she tries to start her life anew, getting a new job and entering into a new same sex relationship; however the adult film industry has taken its toll, leaving her paranoid and mentally, physically and emotionally vulnerable.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is interested in the project, the biggest help for us would be to follow our social media and share with everyone you know - we are looking to crowdfund the remainder of the project, and really want to get this out to as many people as possible!

2568,1.0,6.664889366586244e-38,"I'm going to be frank, I love chatting about music genres. I don't get the hate for it. Identifying traits in music and categorizing it is fun for me. So, with that preface, I want to say this is all meant in the spirit of fun and really just to get some discussion going. 

I would describe myself as a punker, first and foremost—whether my fellow punks agree or not (I'm into mostly melodic punk, Hot Water Music, The Menzingers, BTMI!, Against Me!, etc., etc.). Pop punk, to me, is just a subgenre of the stuff I dig with roots all the way back to the Ramones. Usually with a focus on melodic vocal lines and chugging buzzsaw guitars. Screeching Weasel, Green Day, Teenage Bottlerocket, all the way to what I would consider the modern pop punk groups like Direct Hit!, Off With Their Heads, Goodbye Blue Monday, and Tightwire. Now, read through those bands and make sure to comment which bands are more indicative of the genre, I'll wait. 

Now, here is where I got turned for a loop at some point. The bands I know as pop punk are basically just a subgenre of punk, i.e. they also tour with typical punk bands, but somewhere along the line I became aware of a world that doesn't really touch my own often—a veritable pop punk scene. Here's what I'm talking about: bands like Four Year Strong, A Day to Remember, All Time Low, Boston Manor, New Found Glory, Knuckle Puck. I know nothing about these bands and to me, they are alien and strange. This is not the pop punk I know, and now, with 30 approaching, I am old and scared. 

I'm not hating on them, by the way, I'm just super curious here. Here we have two groups of pop punk bands, and to my mind they don't really interact with each other much (would love examples of the opposite being true though). 

So, let's talk about our experiences. As a fan of one half of the genre, what is your impression of the other half?

Anyone like both?

 Where did the split in these groups happen?

Where do modern emo outfits like Origami Angel and Hot Mulligan fit in?

Any bands that fit into both sides of the coin (my guess here is maybe The Wonder Years?)?

Let's talk shop!"

2573,1.0,3.8721902910561307e-19,"I am an old man and kind of drunk. I’ve been on this subreddit since u\cranberrysmothie founded this place. I’m so Fucking excited about the state of pop punk in 2020. 

I tell people I’m the oldest pop-punk kid. I’m a grown ass man with a mortgage and a wife and all of that, and I’ve never seen a time when it feels like female led bands have been represented so heavily in the scene. 

Meet me @ the Alter may be the best new band in a decade in my opinion.  I feel like they are coming on the scene as strong musically as New Found Glory was when Catalyst came out, and lyrically as strong as Man Overboard was on their self titled album ( I feel like I am alone in not having an issue with MOBs lyrics. They wrote songs about things we all went through and I’ve met literally hundreds of people who have talked to me about how MOB lyrics hit them in the times the needed it. But I am a Stan for them and lucky enough to call those guys friends so is am incredibly fucking biased about this) 

Stand Atlantic have really started pushing the boundaries of what is pop punk., but doing it with the spirit of the scene. Lavender Bones is my favorite full length since 2016 and all of the new tracks are so strong. I find my self listening to Hate Me, Shh and Wavelength for the first time and not super digging them, but knowing they’re amazing and then around the third I’m embarrassing my daughter as we are stopped at a red light. 

The interrupters seems just fucking great. Fight the Good Fight is such a strong album and is so well done that it always feels fun even when tackling harder subject of life, including death and the legacy we leave behind to those we love.  

And then you have all the other amazing bands. 


Hot Milk is absolutely killing it. 

Yours truly is amazing. 

Courage My Love 

Candy Hearts 

There’s just so many great bands, and it feels amazing that the foundations laid by Cherry Bomb and all its members, Patti Smith, Blondie, X-ray Specs, Letters to Cleo, The Donnas, The Distillers and Paramore laid down is the road these bands are leading the charge down in 2020."

498,1.0,2.4534663338862333e-39,"&gt;**Will Clarke**, owner of **Prana Recording Studio** Agency in Atlanta, GA has contributed to this article.

# 1. Practice your songs to a click

Unless you are recording a LIVE album, practicing your music to a metronome makes overdubbing or any sort of correction in **Post-Production** incredibly easy. I know many engineers that will not record without a click simply to avoid the headache. If your musical group has music (*or a drummer*) that fluctuates between tempos, you need to rehearse the music to per-determined **BPM** before showing up to your session.

# 2. Show up Prepared

My opinion is: A great studio session is one that runs quickly and efficiently. If you and your band mates are pressured into last minute problems or troubleshooting (*such as vocal delivery, guitar melody, or rhythm section misalignment*), it can be a real strain on the recording process.

If you are looking to become a session musician, remember this saying: ***You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared.***

# 3. Recording a Song is like building a house

Before you even get to work on the house, you spend hours designing and planning. This is the **Pre-Production Phase**. Finally, you are ready to bring a construction crew to your site of choice… This is your arrival at the Studio. You put down the foundations first, within the context of the greater plan of the house. This is why drums and bass are the first to record, within the context of a scratch guitar or melody track. Next, you put up walls and a roof, essentially closing off the creative box in which you will work. This is the main identifying characteristic of the song (or house), such as lead melodies and vocals, or lead guitar. From there, you add finishing touches — nice railings on the stairs, windows, drywall, insulation, and paint. These are finer details that reinforce the greater creative goal of the song, such as vocal harmonies, horn lines, solo sections, time-based effects, percussion, and texture.

### From my experience, I like to organize my **Recording Process** like this:

1. **Drums + Bass**
2. **Pad** (Rhythm Guitar + Keys) — OR
3. **Melody** (Vocals, guitar, keys, whichever instrument is playing the melody)
4. **Harmony** (Horn section, backing vocals, etc)
5. **Texture** (ambience, percussion, overdubs)

And then of course at any time, any and all of these elements can be re-recorded (*exception here:* ***drums***), edited, moved around, spliced, played backwards, etc.

# 4. You can always add reverb and delay, but it is impossible to get rid of.

Most likely, your mix engineer will add reverb and delay properly. However, some artists are adamant that they know best:

### Scenario 1:

Let’s say you are in a Dream Pop band that has vocals running through a highly saturated vocal effects pedal. Your singer absolutely nails the take of the chorus, except for one thing: the singer accidentally smacks the microphone with their hand because of their \*sick dance moves\*. If you are only recording the vocal signal **wet** (*with effects*) as opposed to **dry** (*without effects*), not only are you recording the physical smack of the microphone, but you also are recording the 2 seconds of reverb that comes after. If you recorded Dry, you can easily edit out the hit and saturate the dry vocals with effects in Post. But if you recorded Wet, this becomes a brutal challenge for even the best engineer.

Mixing Engineers agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove any amount of reverb or delay on a recorded instrument. Which is why we record dry signals and send the performer a wet signal in their monitor mixes. We make separate tracks for important, time-based effects like reverb and delay, and give those effects their own adjustable levels and parameters for real-time monitoring without affecting the integrity of the dry vocal track.

### Scenario 2:

You are the keyboard player of an indie rock band and you are playing a Rhodes. The built in tape delay on your Korg SV1 Keyboard is pretty great! So, you slap it on. Turns out, your delay timing is too long and too prominent in the context of the mix. Unfortunately, in this scenario there is nothing the engineer can do to fix that. ***With any and all time-based effects, you want to start small and build big, or use none at all***. You can always re-amp the clean signal or re-record the instrument with effects to taste.

# 5. Re-amp your guitars for the perfect tone

### Scenario 3:

You are in a Heavy Metal Band. Your guitar player take a 4 bar solo before the Pre-Chorus Breakdown. The amount of Gain and Distortion on this solo must be absolutely Perfect — and while your effects may be incredibly dialed in to your ear, the Engineer always has a different perspective. So the Engineer will split the recording process into two parts:

**Re-Amping** is a non-destructive process of recording a clean tone (usually through a DI box straight from the Guitar) and then re-recording that clean signal into a guitar amp &amp; Pedal effects separately over top of the song at a later time. This gives the band and Engineer the opportunity to fine-tune the gain, distortion, compression and any other effects to perfection without compromising the initial take.

[DI Box](https://i.imgur.com/Fmr88Jt.jpg)

Many engineers split the initial guitar tone and record both a **wet** &amp; **dry** signal, especially in genres of heavily affected guitars (*like Metal, Rock and Roll, Pop, &amp; Psychedelic Rock*). All musicians hold a bias towards the sound of their instrument as it appears to them *while they play*. Which is why when a guitarist hears their own wet take played side by side in context of the full mix, they many times choose the engineer’s.

# 6. Understand the Concept of the “Mix Space”

1. ***Kick Drum*** — center bottom
2. ***Snare*** — lower center, left side
3. ***Cymbals*** — Shimmering over top, spread wide
4. ***Pad*** — fills in the stereo image
5. ***Lead melody*** — loud and proud, center center
6. ***Rhythm guitar*** — center, panned appropriately
7. ***Bass*** — sandwiched between the Kick Drum Low and High

# 7. Make a recording schedule

What days do we do this? What days do we do that? Making a schedule allows you to keep track of your timeline and your budget!

It also helps to keep the recording engineer prepared. Here’s an example:

1. Wednesday = Load In, Set up
2. Thursday = Drums, Bass, Rhythm Section
3. Friday = Vocals, Melody
4. Saturday = Solo Sections, Re-Amping
5. Sunday = Textures, ambience, transitions, finishing touches

# 8. Agree on who wrote the song.

This is important for two reasons — 1. Publishing rights (who takes credit and royalties for the intellectual property of the songwriting) and 2. Who has final say on any creative and technical decisions in the studio, on that song. Knowing who wrote the song will help the Engineer appropriately direct questions and concerns in a 1 on 1 style, instead of towards the whole band (which can lead to time-consuming debate.) This is not a huge deal, but I personally like to be aware of the creative dynamic of whose input is more valuable than others. I’m really only adding this because part of being a recording engineer is working within the dynamic of a group of creative individuals, and you don’t want to accidentally disturb it. And I’ve seen some arguments for sure… moving on.

# 9. No family members or friends while tracking

Please leave your parents and siblings at home. I generally welcome significant others (*because spouses/partners of professional musicians “get it”*) but if your companions in the studio are distracting an engineer while they are working (*or worse, distracting the musician while you are working*), the Engineer might ask them to leave…. its not vacation time for your Engineer. Its ***get-work-done-time***.

# 10 Leave the Drama (and the drugs) at the Door

As a general rule, keep your distractions away from the Engineer. Recording is a very stressful and methodical task. If you’ve got a joint, take it outside. If you’ve got beef with a band mate…

[Yeah, thats gonna be a no from me, dawg](https://i.imgur.com/7ZF9HxL.png)

# 11. Don’t steal our Gaff tape, that stuff is expensive.

\*guilty\*

# 12. Most performance-related flaws can be fixed in post

Miss a note on the solo? **Edit it in post.** Vocalist didn’t deliver that line quite right? **Don’t worry, there’s 12 other takes**. Not enough Reverb? **I Give it the ole’ Re-Amp treatment.** Kick drum is off beat? **Copy, Paste, baby!** Efficiency is the name of the game in the recording process.

*(also, click* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXfK9Osmvs) *if you don't understand the Troggs reference below.... GOLD)*

[The Troggs](https://i.imgur.com/wLu0tiv.jpg)

# 13. However, two things must be addressed immediately: Time and Pitch

This is an objective issue that can foil the recording process. If your engineer tells you that you are either: **Rushing/Dragging** or **Out of Tune**, be cognizant that this small flaw can jeopardize the track later in the Recording Process (when *you add elements like harmony, melody, and texture*).

Which leads nicely into the next tip:

# 14. Tune your instruments in between takes

Please bring a tuner to the session. In general, you should be ultra-aware of your tempo (*if you are a member of the rhythm section*) and your tuning/intonation (*if you are a member of the melody section*).

# 15. Do some exercise/stretches in between takes

This is really important — Exercising in between takes can significantly increase everyone’s mood and energy going back into the studio. You can actually hear the difference in the takes. Not to mention it can help relieve all that stress and any pent up aggression you have towards your band mates. Not only is exercise good for not having a heart attack when you are 50, it’ll actually make the recording process much smoother and make the takes themselves better (*in my opinion*).

[Relevant BoJack is Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/JEKZZed.png)

# 16. Show up prepared… to wait

1. 75% of your time will be spent sitting and waiting, or listening to your band mates record, so bring something to keep you occupied but that won’t take you out of the zone. I recommend a video game that you love but that is also something that you can put down in an instant and that you aren’t really invested in. Something simple, like Mario Kart or Super Smash Brothers, or even a Pokémon game.
2. If you want to stay in a creative vibe, I recommend bringing something to draw or doodle with. Put on some headphones and go dance outside. (We have a Rubix cube that sees a lot of love)
3. The most important thing is not to bring something that will remove you from the mindset of the studio environment. I certainly do not recommend bringing your day job! I’ve heard many times: “I’ll just bring my computer and knock out some emails for my Marketing job while I wait for everyone to finish tracking”. This is a bad idea — it will remove you from the headspace that you, the creative artist, need to be in to make the most out of your time and your engineer’s time. Unless it is related to the Band (*ordering merchandise, responding to Promoters, confirming show details*, *etc*), I would leave it at home.

# 17. Beware of Burrito-itis

Pretty self-explanatory.

# 18. Hot tea makes a good coffee substitute for long recording sessions, but water is even better.

Staying Hydrated is super important, it’ll keep you focused for the longer sessions, not to mention being hydrated is just awesome in general. Also, make sure your vocalist knows about **Throat Coat**, that stuff is the mamma-jammas

[Throat Coat](https://i.imgur.com/lhtmVV0.jpg)

# 19. The engineer is not your enemy

The Recording Engineer has one job: ***Be the bridge that transfers the highest quality version of your music into the physical world***. This manifests itself differently from producer to producer… some engineers are technical producers and some engineers are people producers. It’s a balance of therapy and tough love, tech savvy &amp; emotional capacity, having the mental fortitude to keep going and the discipline to know when you’ve gone far enough. The bottom line — The Engineer is just doing what they believe is the best thing for the final product. So if your engineer delivers constructive criticism to you, such as “*That take was a decent take, but I can hear the energy level dropping a bit. Let’s take 15 and regroup*”… don’t take it personally.

# 20. Bring your A-Game

Aside from the mental discipline needed for an efficient and productive studio session, I argue that every musician should take their instrument to the shop to get “tuned-up” before you begin your session.

1. **Guitarists**: a tune-up can address problems such as: Buzzing frets, Intonation problems, and Electrical noise, and will usually set you up with a set of fresh strings
2. **Vocalists**: Don’t go partying the night before and lose your voice plz &amp; thx — signed, everyone.
3. **Drummers**: Put on new heads before the session and tune your drums every couple hours. Double check the chains on your kick and hi-hat pedals.
4. **Producers**: Check that all your cables, sound cards, interfaces, controllers and adapters are working before coming into the studio. We may not have what you need!
5. **Everyone else**: Don’t make fun of the drummer for tuning their kit, just be proud that they showed up at all (kidding :P)

# 21. The #1 goal should be capturing the energy of the performance

There is an indescribable rush of emotion and power that arises from well-performed and recorded music. It’s like tasting your mom’s signature dish, or watching a group of fighter jets dance in the skies. Where just for a moment, you forget about all the technical barriers and frustrations and troubleshooting… you forget to monitor the faders on your console or the dB levels on your mic pre-amps… and you sit back in awe at the musical masterpiece crafted in front of you. And you look down at your computer screen and watch with a smile as that energy is grasped from the ephemeral and poured like concrete into your hard drive. It’s the absolute best part about being an engineer — Capturing the joy and energy and… well, the magic.

# 22. Don’t suck, Have fun

I’m gonna get a tattoo of this one day.

Thanks for reading :)

July 12, 2020 - After a 9 year hiatus, the pop-punk/hardcore group ​Late Nite Wars​ are reuniting to record their next studio recording. The band will be tracking 5 new songs with the original lineup for the first time since recording “Every Other Saturday” (Arrest Records 2009)
The idea of recording together again began brewing in December of 2018, after a 10 year anniversary reunion show. The following summer, the group began assembling the pieces of what will become their 5th studio recording. In February 2020, shortly after beginning work
with Ryan Stack (​Format Audio​), the process was halted due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The band is now in the final stages of the recording and plan to announce a release date later this year."

Alright, so it's been a few days for us to digest All Time Low's newest single: Some Kind of Disaster. We spent plenty of time putting up with their social media blackout and cryptic teasers throughout the first 20 days of the month, so how are we feeling about it? Was it worth it? 

'Some Kind of Disaster is the comeback single every band strives for' says one well-worded Twitter user (BaraPinkRanger). So far, I honestly haven't met a single person who actually dislikes the song. I can't be the only one finding it hard to not binge the song to the point that I hate it, right? To be fair, the only single knock I can give it is the fact that a few friends and I have some loose plans to create a cover of this absolute bop, yet I'm actually having a lot of trouble hearing the bass. So it's a little difficult for me to play! Despite the painfully long wait, it would seem the majority can agree that the Some Kind of Disaster is indeed great.

Of course, that also means the amount of people sleuthing around the teasers, music video, and old tweets from Alex are hard at work making their theories! What have you found? So far the term 'Life Is Strange' is making an appearance, new album title perhaps?

All in all, we want to know every thought you have on Some Kind of Disaster!

You're still reading? Okay, gotcha. Who's 'we' you ask? I'm Kenna, and I speak on behalf of the Official All Time Low Discord server! If you're still here I'm going to take a wild guess saying that you like All Time Low. Which is great! Because we do too! We would utterly love to have you. We actually just hit 100 members the day before SKoD dropped, we have plenty of celebration plans. I'm going to be real with you here, joining this server was one of the best decisions I've made, as extravagant as that sounds. I have met so, SO many epic people there, and I've found we all have a lot more in common than just a shared love of All Time Low. 

You can join with the link [Here!](https://discord.gg/6eQfJZ) We hope to see you there! Stay cool \~ Kenna"
2247,1.0,3.637509125100553e-21,"I generally an avid pop punk fan on this reddit, I've posted a few times searching for people to make music with or just to listen to new stuff from people.... well people who are like us! That's why we are all here right? :D

A handful of you guys encouraged and helped me improve when it came to recording so I wanted to revisit the song I shared here months ago, and rework with everything I learned so far. Don't expect the next ""knuckle puck"" or anything like that! lol

I'll post it in the comments below! Also don't forget!

To share your quarantine pop punk inspired tracks in the comments! I wanna hear them! :D

  
Now for my story behind this (tl:dr below):

Last I posted I was barely getting my feet in to recording music, I honestly found what worked for me with my iPad Air 2 and a Peavey VIP amp. I'm not making music to aim to be famous or anything like that, someone on a subreddit called ""sharemusic"" talked about how to make music that you yourself would want to listen to. If you can enjoy your own tracks on loop, than chances are someone else might too. With a changed mindset I started experimenting and playing around with the sound and styles I like. 

But everyone says my music sounds ""pop punk"" still (probably cause it's a huge backbone to what I like) but my gf says it reminds her of kung fu generation, or maybe something punk rock or pop rock. But she says that she can hear the pop punk influences in the tracks. I know people on here have expressed that early Kung Fu Generation has a lot of pop punk influence in their music. But...... why bring all this up? Well during that time I was searching to make music, I kept putting my mind in this box of it has to sound ""pop punk"" I had even made a song and shared it here and there were people who liked but everyone said it was missing that extra punch, but they could see potential. Then a few recorded tracks later, I wanted to revisit the song with a fresh mind and made something that made me look back on what got me here. Which was all you guys! FloodTide and JayHaze42 I know ya'll are here! Thank you!  


I want to share that song with you! Obviously it's not ""professional"" sounding. But I hope you can hear that I truly had fun making the song and with that I can close that song knowing I did right by it. Ya know?   
Also I'll post it in the comments below cause I don't want it to be view as spamming a selfish promo, that way only those interested in this post and are curious after reading it can find it below.  


TL;DR - I once posted looking for musicians to collab with to make music, I showed people my stuff and everyone here helped me find my path to recording. I learned to carry forth what I love about pop punk but also not limit myself to a ""pop punk"" only mindset. Recently I wanted to ""do right"" and go back to that song that started it all. The very song I shared here. I added new stuff played around with it and now I want to share it in the comments below. What you guys helped me make, coming from zero knowledge recording lol, like I didn't know what a BPM even was.

  
Thanks everyone!"

3768,1.0,4.455449490499878e-16," So I have a cool story i thought id share !  


&gt;*In 2017 I got free tickets to my second blink-182 concert ,the first one i went to my ex made us leave 4 songs into blink 182 and it was the worst experience of my life we were so far back! So the second one I got there a few hours early. I remember hearing them sound check and looking through a crack to see them and saying ""look how close they are!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*So.... Being in the first 20 people in i was right in front of Mark and about half-way through Blinks set Mark said ""theres a guy we met in the meet and greet earlier who's bragging he could play all our songs"" where you at? come up here and play"" ... So instantly I hated the guy , he looked like something out of waynes world and he was playing with my favorite Band... well to everyones astonishment he gave the guitar back to Matt Skiba and looked embarressed said ""i cant play"" dove into the crowd and vanished ... I told my then new but now ex-girlfriend ""watch this"" and started trying to get marks attention. well I did and he asked what song i wanted to play so of course i said Adams Song and he said noooo so i said stay together for the kids and they hadnt played it ...SO I did mess up in the begining but i did perfect after we restarted! even somehow improvising a solo with a pick slide!! The best things in life are free!!!! all thanks to Tom Delonge quitting the band! i feel like the only one who is thankful for that!!*

SO Since that day I have worked super hard to put my own sound together with a heavy blink influence ..... yesterday someone who doesn't even know me who heard my first single ( it came out yesterday) said it reminds him of ""the old blink-182"" which is literally the biggest compliment I could ever hope to get! So I figured i'd share it with all of the blink fans out there!!"
3501,1.0,1.5042258876418738e-16,"Hi guys, 

If you were to form a band with any musicians which one would you choose ? I guess any number and type of instrument is fine. Don't worry about anything consistent in terms of style.

I'll start :

Voice : Matt Young (Amber Pacific)
Lead Guitar : Shintaro Suga (Dustbox)
Rythm Guitar : Steve Klein (New Found Glory)
Bass : Dan Andriano (Alkaline Trio)
Drums : Travis Barker (Blink-182)

Songwriting : Matt Skiba (Alkaline Trio)"

2061,1.0,3.9995278942191387e-25,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask the question but some people have been saying ""Emo rap"" and the future of rock have more in common than many people think, eg Epitaph Records signing Lil Lotus and guccihighwaters couple months ago, Belmont doing a collaboration with Shinigami [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t44v2tYnYdY)

so what exactly is the genre/scene can we name for artists like Lil Lotus, Shinigami, 93feetofsmoke, and Nothing, nowhere?

punk rap? emo rap? trap emo? metal trap?

Other artists like Lil Narnia, Lil Lotus, Shinigami, Fatse, guardin, sadeyes, and countless others are pioneering a new genre that doesn't really have a set categorization yet and it really bothers me bc I really like their kind of music(coming from liking bands like tssf, the wonder years, knuckle puck, neck deep, nfg). It has all the kind of angry/sadness but rather than using live drums/heavy bass they're but using trap beats instead.

So what do you really think of these kinds of a new genre? and what should we call it?

  
p.s check them out if you haven't, I promise it'd be worth your time.

3723,1.0,1.149517670587825e-17,"First off, I want to start off by stating that I am a very, VERY big fan of Pop Punk music, as it includes both the hardworking, DIY aesthetic of punk rock with a clean sound that is easily digestible for all audiences. Basically it’s a genius way for complex thoughts and ideas to be condensed into an easy to swallow format for the general public. I honestly believe that, if all public schooling in the United States was conducted via a series of educational pop punk albums, we’d be number one in standardized test scores. 

That being said, there is a major problem that plagues the pop punk industry: financial stability. Very few pop punk bands achieve success to a point where they can focus on putting out quality music, without having to worry about their next meal. Since very few share our patricians taste, these pop punk legends will not receive the monetary compensation, and will likely be forced to leave the field of pop punk sometime in their late 20s or whenever their groupies stop being in high school. No doubt financial security is a concern, for both the artist and the artist listener. 

To combat this epidemic, I’ve thought of an idea that *should* assist in the abolition of such woes in the pop punk world. 

Before stating my idea, I’d like to explain the concept of a “Court Painter”. Throughout much of European history, a court painter was, basically, a private artist. Royalty would hire these artists to make paintings of them, and they’d be paid handsomely solely for making painting for the family. These artists were provided with a living space and a workshop, and had one job: make beautiful pieces of art. It should also be noted that these artists were, essentially, slaves, as they could not leave the premises and had to constantly be working on artwork (sans time allotted for eating and sleeping). I believe this method can still be applied today

Basically, instead of purchasing the albums and merchandise created by bands, we must start purchasing the bands themselves. By purchasing the members of the band, we are able to have them focused on the creation of beautiful pop punk music 24/7, without them having to worry about their personal finances. 

With private pop punk bands, there are many benefits. Lyrics can be written by bands to best reflect your then current mood. Private pop punk bands also perform live whenever you see most fit."

Can anyone give me some of the best albums to come out in the past 5 years or so? I was a big fan of the wonder years, fireworks, transit, man overboard, crucial dudes and stuff like that if that helps and obviously the classics like blink, nfg, the starting line, saves the day etc"

3722,1.0,2.0401810095685205e-14,"Dear Hot Mulligan,

You inspired me to write muisc. The song I Fell in love and wait for it made me realized I didn't need fancy solos to write a emotional song. I can just repeat the same riff and it feel have the same effect. I remember sitting in my room I had opportunities and SGY on repeat. I didn't know how to play the guitar but I picked it up and messed around with the guitar. I just wanted to put my feelings into something. So that's what I did. I'm about to write a song with two of my favorite pop punk singers because of you. Also I got alot of great memories but I already told you a long time ago.


Keep up the good work and thank you. Have a great hoilday or merry Christmas."

3095,1.0,1.873752833204437e-15,"Hi everyone! I’ve recently been getting back into pop punk, but it’s mainly stuff from back in the early 2000s such as blink, sum 41 and simple plan. I want to branch out to newer pop punk bands but I don’t know where to begin. 

I really like Neck Deep’s “Life’s not out to get you”, but most of their other stuff I don’t really like. In your opinion what are the best modern pop punk bands?"
2671,1.0,9.141351424722998e-15,"For those who don't remember the band Sullivan, they were an emo and pop-punk influenced pop rock band on Tooth &amp; Nail in the mid-aughts. If you haven't heard their first two albums, I can't recommend them enough; they've held up and grown with me in ways that a lot of albums from that period haven't. Their third is less important. It was a decent reunion album.

However, I'm not here just to talk about Sullivan. I'm here to talk about the lead vocalist's current project, Surprises. They released a pop-punk (like windows down, summery pop-punk) album last year called Natural Disaster, and it's one of the best pop-punk albums I've heard in a very long time. I remembered he was supposed to be working on something and found this album a few days ago. I haven't been able to stop listening. The feeling of finding new music by an artist who meant that much to you is truly incredible, and I just wanted to share the joy!

Recommended songs for dipping your toes into Sullivan: Down Here, We All Float and F-Stop.

Recommended songs for dipping your toes into Surprises: Just start the album from the beginning and see what you think."

We have been running a book club for rock albums for 4 months, where we take 3 rock related albums a week (1 voted on by users, 1 chosen at random from user submissions, and 1 chosen by a member of staff) and we listen/discuss/rate them as a group. We only review rock but we all have additional interests and there is more and more cross over work being done. We are in week 17 now and have around 70 members currently. This week we are doing only monthly new album week (theme 2016 to now) with artists Benjamin Booker, Good Tiger, and David Bowie. In the past have reviewed albums from Soundgarden, Jethro Tull, Kaleo, Mastodon, and Green Day to name a few. We have members from all over the world of varied ages, sexes, beliefs and backgrounds. We don't all like the same rock but even those who are more picky have found new music to enjoy. We talk about the weirdest metal to the most light of pop rock songs.
If this sounds like something you would enjoy, we welcome you to follow this link. Just read and agree to the rules when you join then enjoy. https://discord.gg/UZbySAd"

3421,1.0,1.2537865434880864e-30,"Hello everyone, this post is pretty much summed up within the title but I wanted to give some background as to why I'm asking this. Hopefully it'll spawn some meaningful discussion. I haven't been on here in a while, but I used to post all the time on my old account, u/slchawk. I got locked out of that account and have never been able to get back into it, that's another story for another day. But in my time on this subreddit between both accounts I've noticed that a lot of new bands that try to post material on here often stay buried underneath all of the music videos and things that get posted about the bigger bands. A lot of new bands never seem to get many upvotes or comments at all, let alone crack the front page, and that's got to hurt a lot if you're a pop punk band that doesn't make a splash on a pop punk subreddit.

There was, however, one band that seemed very different, at least for a short period of time. Boxford, a band out of Virginia Beach, made it to the front page with one of their music videos or singles, and the subreddit ate it up. It was a huge day for them, making such a splash, and it was inspiring to me since I am a musician/songwriter myself. I loved the few tunes they had on Spotify and bumped them all the time. I don't know if any of you guys have kept up with them, but unfortunately they announced that they were breaking up today. I was able to talk to their drummer a little bit today and found out that one of the reasons they had to end things was that it's just so hard to make it anywhere as a new band nowadays. He said the market is so saturated and being someone who is interested in these types of things, it does sometimes seem like to me that as ""the new era of pop punk bands"" have cemented themselves in everyone's minds, it's hard to determine when/if there will be a fourth major wave. (First being like: Green Day, blink, Sum 41, etc. Second being easycore/genre blending stuff like ADTR and FYS, third being TSSF, Knuckle Puck, Grayscale, Neck Deep, etc).

My question to you is, being someone who is going to release my first record ever in the coming months, what do you guys look for? How can I make sure that I'm not buried with the others? Of course I believe my songwriting talent's there, I feel like the songs are passionate and catchy yet have an edge... Some of them have been songs I've worked on for years --- but how do people like myself and others reach you guys without it feeling inauthentic or forced? What do you like to see in new bands? I've got several albums songs written already and I want to get as many of them as I can out there. Doing this DIY is rewarding and fun, but it's admittedly scary too.

So I was just wondering; what do you guys really look for? It seems like a simple question but I think it's a lot more than just the sound... Lots to think about and discuss here, hopefully ☺️

Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any and all recommendations.

*Disclaimer* I'm not saying Boxford failed, by the way. They played Warped Tour and that's one of those things that can never be taken away. I love their music and it blows that they had to split but life has different plans for different people. I'm just polling others' opinions on what causes so many bands to never get traction and what you guys like to see."

I heard someone saying that they should get Joe from Knuckle Puck as their new frontman. Although I think that would be cool, I don't see that happening. Joe has two musical projects right now with KP and his side-band ***rationale.*** with former Real Friends's vocalist Dan Lambton. And he's really close friends with Dan, so I don't think he'll say yes if he gets the offer, out of pure respect he has to Dan. Also, Real Friends' style of pop punk is pretty similar to KP's, so I would feel that I was listening to Knuckle Puck instead of Real Friends."

3795,1.0,5.670498794078223e-15,"I've been really into Foxing recently, and reflecting on the album Nearer My God got me thinking about *why* I like it. I began realizing it had a few similarities with other albums I liked quite a bit, even though stylistically it isn't terribly similar. I've sort of narrowed what I think the similarities are down to the followong:

'Wall of noise' - heavy use of white noise, feedback, and other random noises that all seem to fit the song, and takes up significant amounts of the ending mix. Important/repeated melodies will pan in and out of the wall and chaos frequently. Lo-fi sounding recording used frequently. See: Grand Paradise, Pull, Limousine, Vices

Layered vocals - used much like an instrument to add to the wall of noise. At times pretty well hidden within the mix. Often distorted, naturally and via effects. 
See: Leather Daddy, Luca, At the Bottom, Five Cups

Incredible dynamics - All of these albums will have you constantly messing with your volume knob, but to just sit and enjoy the volume shifts, stacking sounds, or lack there of is phenomenal on all of these.
See: Sowing Season, Won't Drown, Noro, Hate TKO

Relatively cryptic lyrics, often having religious undertones.

These bands all also seem to have 'cult followings' leading me to believe other people actively seek out these qualities too.

Mike Sapone has used these elements in other bands he's worked with like Taking Back Sunday, and Sorority Noise, so I've been wondering if it really did originate with him and Brand New, or if maybe there was someone earlier, or other people making similar music? 

Anybody have any insight into the origins of the sound, or similar acts to recommend?"
2580,1.0,1.0040595065829934e-29,"I found this pretty interesting... Does anybody remember Hawk Nelson from back in the day? They had (what I think are) two really great pop-punk records come out: Letters To The President (2003) and Smile, It's the End of the World (2006). I was 13 and 16 when they came out so maybe me being young had something to do with me liking them more because they were pretty polarizing for being one of those Christian bands that's not, but definitely is. You know what I mean? Like, ""We're not a Christian band; we're Christians in a band,"" like MxPx or Five Iron Frenzy. So that meant the punk scene didn't always like them because they were too Christian and the Christian scene didn't always like them because they were too punk...

Anyway, I liked those two albums even though i look back at them now as the poor man's MxPx. Well they put out five records total from 2003 up until 2013 as the pop punk group and then frontman Jason Dunn left the band, the guitarist Jon Steingard was moved up from lead guitars to frontman and they rebranded a contemporary CCM (Christian contemporary) group. It was so strange, but by the time they did that I had long quit listening. I remember giving their third and fourth album each a listen and being underwhelmed. I still dig those first two. If nothing more, they're nostalgic.

Which brings me to why I'm posting and wondering if any of you know anything about any of this. I remember Jason leaving so abruptly and couldn't tell if it was actually amicable or if it was just positive ""don't burn bridges"" PR from both sides... I just remembered all of this for some reason and tried to do some digging and can't find anything. Jason doesn't follow any of the original members or new members of Hawk Nelson on Instagram and none of them follow him. Even more bizarre considering that I know Daniel Biro, the bassist and only original member left, was a groomsman in Jason's first wedding and Jason was one in his. I just find that so odd and wonder if any of you remember any of this or have any info."
2113,1.0,9.43360649056407e-14,"@@@skip to point 3 if you just wanna get to the meat of it@@@

Hey guys. So for starters, wow. It’s been forever since I’ve been on this subreddit. Literally years. So I was heavily in the scene back in what I consider the “glory days”, circa 2012-2016. My high school years, pretty much. And as a large majority of us do, we move on to other genres when we near our twenties. Due to changing tastes in both the music scene, and yourself. Whatever. But some time down the road we all come back to revisit a couple albums that we deemed to be the best back in our days. For me it was Copacetic. And it’s absolutely mind blowing to revisit this album again. So here’s a couple points/observations that I’ve gathered over the past few months of me listening to it daily once again. 

1) this is the best goddamn album ever. It was my top album of all time back then, left that slot when I moved away from the genre, and it’s back on top. For good this time. 

2) the absolute musical intricacy these guys have is insane. And this specific album really highlights that. Specifically how heavily their entire style relies on the drummer. As a POP PUNK BAND. That’s unheard of. 

3) my biggest point of all, and a long one. I remember when this album first came out, one of the primary talking points on this subreddit was how the lyricism never really made any sense. Like Joe just couldn’t really string together a story right. Now that I’m revisiting this album, just the way this guy can paint pictures, wow. His lyrics are nothing short of perfect for what he’s trying to portray. And I think that one of the biggest reasons we thought this back then was because our high school brains (and ik all of your asses were in high school too) just couldn’t comprehend the sheer calibre of stress that adult life, and specifically adjusting to it, can bring. And this whole album is about coming to maturity and the overwhelming scale of pain you’re about to endure while you adjust to it. You’re literally lost for a bit while you figure it out. Take it from a guy that’s nearing 23 and FINALLY got out of the scare years of adulthood, from the ages of 19-22 you’ll question what you’re doing with your life daily, and have existential crisis’s daily. I don’t care who you are, it’s gonna happen. To every single one of us. Our stressors in high school consisted of girl problems, and girl problems. Which is probably why we had such a hard time appreciating Joes lyrics. “Give them what they want to see, a kid lost in his twenties” is just so unbelievably real that I literally “felt the rush of blood beneath my skin” after hearing that lyric for the first time in years. To be cheesy. 

Either way, it was just a really mind opening experience to listen to Copacetic again after all these years. I haven’t connected to an album like this ever until I picked it up again. I find a lot of comfort in it, and it has tremendously helped me just stabilize my mind in adulthood, and has helped me accept that shits gonna suck and always will suck. Cause that’s life. It’s what you make of it that counts. And if you’re going through that early adulthood crisis, listen to Copacetic again. I hope it’ll bring you comfort like it brought me."
2379,1.0,2.4534663338862333e-39,"&gt;**Will Clarke**, owner of **Prana Recording Studio** Agency in Atlanta, GA has contributed to this article.

# 1. Practice your songs to a click

Unless you are recording a LIVE album, practicing your music to a metronome makes overdubbing or any sort of correction in **Post-Production** incredibly easy. I know many engineers that will not record without a click simply to avoid the headache. If your musical group has music (*or a drummer*) that fluctuates between tempos, you need to rehearse the music to per-determined **BPM** before showing up to your session.

# 2. Show up Prepared

My opinion is: A great studio session is one that runs quickly and efficiently. If you and your band mates are pressured into last minute problems or troubleshooting (*such as vocal delivery, guitar melody, or rhythm section misalignment*), it can be a real strain on the recording process.

If you are looking to become a session musician, remember this saying: ***You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared.***

# 3. Recording a Song is like building a house

Before you even get to work on the house, you spend hours designing and planning. This is the **Pre-Production Phase**. Finally, you are ready to bring a construction crew to your site of choice… This is your arrival at the Studio. You put down the foundations first, within the context of the greater plan of the house. This is why drums and bass are the first to record, within the context of a scratch guitar or melody track. Next, you put up walls and a roof, essentially closing off the creative box in which you will work. This is the main identifying characteristic of the song (or house), such as lead melodies and vocals, or lead guitar. From there, you add finishing touches — nice railings on the stairs, windows, drywall, insulation, and paint. These are finer details that reinforce the greater creative goal of the song, such as vocal harmonies, horn lines, solo sections, time-based effects, percussion, and texture.

### From my experience, I like to organize my **Recording Process** like this:

1. **Drums + Bass**
2. **Pad** (Rhythm Guitar + Keys) — OR
3. **Melody** (Vocals, guitar, keys, whichever instrument is playing the melody)
4. **Harmony** (Horn section, backing vocals, etc)
5. **Texture** (ambience, percussion, overdubs)

And then of course at any time, any and all of these elements can be re-recorded (*exception here:* ***drums***), edited, moved around, spliced, played backwards, etc.

# 4. You can always add reverb and delay, but it is impossible to get rid of.

Most likely, your mix engineer will add reverb and delay properly. However, some artists are adamant that they know best:

### Scenario 1:

Let’s say you are in a Dream Pop band that has vocals running through a highly saturated vocal effects pedal. Your singer absolutely nails the take of the chorus, except for one thing: the singer accidentally smacks the microphone with their hand because of their \*sick dance moves\*. If you are only recording the vocal signal **wet** (*with effects*) as opposed to **dry** (*without effects*), not only are you recording the physical smack of the microphone, but you also are recording the 2 seconds of reverb that comes after. If you recorded Dry, you can easily edit out the hit and saturate the dry vocals with effects in Post. But if you recorded Wet, this becomes a brutal challenge for even the best engineer.

Mixing Engineers agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove any amount of reverb or delay on a recorded instrument. Which is why we record dry signals and send the performer a wet signal in their monitor mixes. We make separate tracks for important, time-based effects like reverb and delay, and give those effects their own adjustable levels and parameters for real-time monitoring without affecting the integrity of the dry vocal track.

### Scenario 2:

You are the keyboard player of an indie rock band and you are playing a Rhodes. The built in tape delay on your Korg SV1 Keyboard is pretty great! So, you slap it on. Turns out, your delay timing is too long and too prominent in the context of the mix. Unfortunately, in this scenario there is nothing the engineer can do to fix that. ***With any and all time-based effects, you want to start small and build big, or use none at all***. You can always re-amp the clean signal or re-record the instrument with effects to taste.

# 5. Re-amp your guitars for the perfect tone

### Scenario 3:

You are in a Heavy Metal Band. Your guitar player take a 4 bar solo before the Pre-Chorus Breakdown. The amount of Gain and Distortion on this solo must be absolutely Perfect — and while your effects may be incredibly dialed in to your ear, the Engineer always has a different perspective. So the Engineer will split the recording process into two parts:

**Re-Amping** is a non-destructive process of recording a clean tone (usually through a DI box straight from the Guitar) and then re-recording that clean signal into a guitar amp &amp; Pedal effects separately over top of the song at a later time. This gives the band and Engineer the opportunity to fine-tune the gain, distortion, compression and any other effects to perfection without compromising the initial take.

[DI Box](https://i.imgur.com/Fmr88Jt.jpg)

Many engineers split the initial guitar tone and record both a **wet** &amp; **dry** signal, especially in genres of heavily affected guitars (*like Metal, Rock and Roll, Pop, &amp; Psychedelic Rock*). All musicians hold a bias towards the sound of their instrument as it appears to them *while they play*. Which is why when a guitarist hears their own wet take played side by side in context of the full mix, they many times choose the engineer’s.

# 6. Understand the Concept of the “Mix Space”

1. ***Kick Drum*** — center bottom
2. ***Snare*** — lower center, left side
3. ***Cymbals*** — Shimmering over top, spread wide
4. ***Pad*** — fills in the stereo image
5. ***Lead melody*** — loud and proud, center center
6. ***Rhythm guitar*** — center, panned appropriately
7. ***Bass*** — sandwiched between the Kick Drum Low and High

[Blues Band Mix Space — Globe Institute of Recording &amp; Production](https://i.imgur.com/QoSfpm0.jpg)

# 7. Make a recording schedule

What days do we do this? What days do we do that? Making a schedule allows you to keep track of your timeline and your budget!

It also helps to keep the recording engineer prepared. Here’s an example:

1. Wednesday = Load In, Set up
2. Thursday = Drums, Bass, Rhythm Section
3. Friday = Vocals, Melody
4. Saturday = Solo Sections, Re-Amping
5. Sunday = Textures, ambience, transitions, finishing touches

# 8. Agree on who wrote the song.

This is important for two reasons — 1. Publishing rights (who takes credit and royalties for the intellectual property of the songwriting) and 2. Who has final say on any creative and technical decisions in the studio, on that song. Knowing who wrote the song will help the Engineer appropriately direct questions and concerns in a 1 on 1 style, instead of towards the whole band (which can lead to time-consuming debate.) This is not a huge deal, but I personally like to be aware of the creative dynamic of whose input is more valuable than others. I’m really only adding this because part of being a recording engineer is working within the dynamic of a group of creative individuals, and you don’t want to accidentally disturb it. And I’ve seen some arguments for sure… moving on.

# 9. No family members or friends while tracking

Please leave your parents and siblings at home. I generally welcome significant others (*because spouses/partners of professional musicians “get it”*) but if your companions in the studio are distracting an engineer while they are working (*or worse, distracting the musician while you are working*), the Engineer might ask them to leave…. its not vacation time for your Engineer. Its ***get-work-done-time***.

# 10 Leave the Drama (and the drugs) at the Door

As a general rule, keep your distractions away from the Engineer. Recording is a very stressful and methodical task. If you’ve got a joint, take it outside. If you’ve got beef with a band mate…

[Yeah, thats gonna be a no from me, dawg](https://i.imgur.com/7ZF9HxL.png)

# 11. Don’t steal our Gaff tape, that stuff is expensive.

\*guilty\*

# 12. Most performance-related flaws can be fixed in post

Miss a note on the solo? **Edit it in post.** Vocalist didn’t deliver that line quite right? **Don’t worry, there’s 12 other takes**. Not enough Reverb? **I Give it the ole’ Re-Amp treatment.** Kick drum is off beat? **Copy, Paste, baby!** Efficiency is the name of the game in the recording process.

*(also, click* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXfK9Osmvs) *if you don't understand the Troggs reference below.... GOLD)*

[The Troggs](https://i.imgur.com/wLu0tiv.jpg)

# 13. However, two things must be addressed immediately: Time and Pitch

This is an objective issue that can foil the recording process. If your engineer tells you that you are either: **Rushing/Dragging** or **Out of Tune**, be cognizant that this small flaw can jeopardize the track later in the Recording Process (when *you add elements like harmony, melody, and texture*).

Which leads nicely into the next tip:

# 14. Tune your instruments in between takes

Please bring a tuner to the session. In general, you should be ultra-aware of your tempo (*if you are a member of the rhythm section*) and your tuning/intonation (*if you are a member of the melody section*).

# 15. Do some exercise/stretches in between takes

This is really important — Exercising in between takes can significantly increase everyone’s mood and energy going back into the studio. You can actually hear the difference in the takes. Not to mention it can help relieve all that stress and any pent up aggression you have towards your band mates. Not only is exercise good for not having a heart attack when you are 50, it’ll actually make the recording process much smoother and make the takes themselves better (*in my opinion*).

[Relevant BoJack is Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/JEKZZed.png)

# 16. Show up prepared… to wait

1. 75% of your time will be spent sitting and waiting, or listening to your band mates record, so bring something to keep you occupied but that won’t take you out of the zone. I recommend a video game that you love but that is also something that you can put down in an instant and that you aren’t really invested in. Something simple, like Mario Kart or Super Smash Brothers, or even a Pokémon game.
2. If you want to stay in a creative vibe, I recommend bringing something to draw or doodle with. Put on some headphones and go dance outside. (We have a Rubix cube that sees a lot of love)
3. The most important thing is not to bring something that will remove you from the mindset of the studio environment. I certainly do not recommend bringing your day job! I’ve heard many times: “I’ll just bring my computer and knock out some emails for my Marketing job while I wait for everyone to finish tracking”. This is a bad idea — it will remove you from the headspace that you, the creative artist, need to be in to make the most out of your time and your engineer’s time. Unless it is related to the Band (*ordering merchandise, responding to Promoters, confirming show details*, *etc*), I would leave it at home.

# 17. Beware of Burrito-itis

Pretty self-explanatory.

# 18. Hot tea makes a good coffee substitute for long recording sessions, but water is even better.

Staying Hydrated is super important, it’ll keep you focused for the longer sessions, not to mention being hydrated is just awesome in general. Also, make sure your vocalist knows about **Throat Coat**, that stuff is the mamma-jammas

[Throat Coat](https://i.imgur.com/lhtmVV0.jpg)

# 19. The engineer is not your enemy

The Recording Engineer has one job: ***Be the bridge that transfers the highest quality version of your music into the physical world***. This manifests itself differently from producer to producer… some engineers are technical producers and some engineers are people producers. It’s a balance of therapy and tough love, tech savvy &amp; emotional capacity, having the mental fortitude to keep going and the discipline to know when you’ve gone far enough. The bottom line — The Engineer is just doing what they believe is the best thing for the final product. So if your engineer delivers constructive criticism to you, such as “*That take was a decent take, but I can hear the energy level dropping a bit. Let’s take 15 and regroup*”… don’t take it personally.

# 20. Bring your A-Game

Aside from the mental discipline needed for an efficient and productive studio session, I argue that every musician should take their instrument to the shop to get “tuned-up” before you begin your session.

1. **Guitarists**: a tune-up can address problems such as: Buzzing frets, Intonation problems, and Electrical noise, and will usually set you up with a set of fresh strings
2. **Vocalists**: Don’t go partying the night before and lose your voice plz &amp; thx — signed, everyone.
3. **Drummers**: Put on new heads before the session and tune your drums every couple hours. Double check the chains on your kick and hi-hat pedals.
4. **Producers**: Check that all your cables, sound cards, interfaces, controllers and adapters are working before coming into the studio. We may not have what you need!
5. **Everyone else**: Don’t make fun of the drummer for tuning their kit, just be proud that they showed up at all (kidding :P)

# 21. The #1 goal should be capturing the energy of the performance

There is an indescribable rush of emotion and power that arises from well-performed and recorded music. It’s like tasting your mom’s signature dish, or watching a group of fighter jets dance in the skies. Where just for a moment, you forget about all the technical barriers and frustrations and troubleshooting… you forget to monitor the faders on your console or the dB levels on your mic pre-amps… and you sit back in awe at the musical masterpiece crafted in front of you. And you look down at your computer screen and watch with a smile as that energy is grasped from the ephemeral and poured like concrete into your hard drive. It’s the absolute best part about being an engineer — Capturing the joy and energy and… well, the magic.

# 22. Don’t suck, Have fun

I’m gonna get a tattoo of this one day.

Thanks for reading :)

2392,1.0,1.0081783696697512e-52,"Pop punk means the world to me. I remember being a teenager feeling lost in the world. Dealing with anxiety, depression and ton of other stuff. I didn't fit in school and I felt werid showing my emotions to people. Pop punk bands like Real Friends, The Story So Far, Neck Deep, old Basement, Knuckle Puck, Title Fight, The Wonder Years, Man Overboard, Roam, Moose Blood, Citizen, This Time Next Year, Tiger Jaws, Set Your Goals, I Call Five, Trash Boat, with the punches, Boston Manor, Fireworks, Polar Bear Club, hit the lights, in her own words, Four Year Strong, Such Gold, Grayscale, Seaway, Major League, For The Win, old turnover,  Sudden Suspension, Crucial Dudes, Forever came calling, handguns, Transit and a ton of those early 2000s and early 2010s pop punk bands got me through those hard times but also there during the best times in my life. Their lyrics made me feel at home. It felt like a hug. I felt like the words hug me and made me feel better. I still love pop punk and i still listen to a ton of those bands. Also pop punk makes me feel nostalgic and takes me back to better days. Listening to those bands bring me back to times waking up at 5 in the morning to watch night sky turn into the sunrise. Singing my heart out to Sudden Suspension and Standridge promotion bandcamp compilation."

1954,1.0,1.9534186661952313e-30,"ive been in the pop-punk community since 7th grade. since that time, ive discovered a lot of pop-punk bands that don't get as much attention as they should. if you're looking to check out some of those bands and freshen up your playlist, here they are:

• Between You and Me: they're a pop-punk/emo band from Australia and all of the songs ive heard by them are bangers. i recommend their songs Overthinking, World in Grey, and Cut Me Some Slack.

• AS IT IS: they're possibly the best British pop-punk band ive ever listened to, mainly for their raw and honest lyrics, and their unique sound. i recommend their songs Soap, Drowning Deep In Doubt, and Bitter Broken Me.

• Makeout: they have a lot of cheesy songs, but they're still fun and energetic nonetheless. i recommend their songs Lisa, Till We're Gone, and Childish.

• Trash Boat: they're one of the few punk rock bands left in the modern era, and all of the songs ive heard from them have so much energy and rawness to them. i recommend their songs Eleven, Don't Open Your Eyes, and Catharsis.

• Tonight Alive: if you throughout that Paramore was the only good pop-punk band with a female lead, you thought wrong. Tonight Alive are an AMAZING Australian pop-punk band with an amazing female lead, Jenna McDougall. i recommend their songs Wasting Away, Come Home, and The Edge.

• Story Untold: the best Canadian pop-punk band that's here to make up for Simple Plan's mistakes. i recommend their songs Mental Breakdown, Dreams That We Don't Share, and California.

that's all the ones i got! happy listening! &lt;3"
3533,1.0,2.4880442684513087e-17,"So as a lot of people here probably as well, I am a 90s kid. I grew up listening to Blink 182 on my way to houseparties on weekends, bingewatching American Pie and dying my hair listening to Offspring while feeling like the biggest punk in the world. While my taste in music eventually matured, and I got into more heavier music, I never really lost my love for powerchords and nanana‘s.   

Sadly tho, Pop Punk changed drastically with the 2010s, and my taste in Pop Punk didn‘t change with it back then. So I stuck with the same old bands except for a couple exceptions (mainly Neck Deep, who I‘d still consider to be quite oldschool tho).   

Anyways, lately I‘ve been trying to get into some modern Pop Punk stuff, and to my surprise I actually quite liked a bit of it. I love ROAM, or Grayscales song „Young“ for example. The problem is that it‘s been 10 years now, and I kinda feel owerwhelmed with all the bands I missed.   

Long story short: Help me catch up on the best Pop Punk stuff I missed in the last 10 years. Thanks!"

I listened to it in high school which was 8+ yrs ago and I don't remember any of the lyrics, otherwise I would've found it by now and wouldn't be asking here. It was an emo punk rock song, similar to the sounds of All Time Low and Mayday Parade, but it was neither of these. Its not dashboard confessional or any of these. It was a one hit wonder and not very popular at all, I think it may only have 1m views by now, if that. It wasn't by a very popular band. What I can do, is describe the video. It was an all guy band and the singer had long black hair. The song was about a relationship, like the ins and outs of it and it was describing missing the girl that broke up with him because, I think, she left him for someone else. Some of it was shot on a rooftop, and the rest was depicting events about the relationship. At one point they went to a fair/carnival, and did a picture booth, and it recapped the pics they took. Thats about all that I remember, I hope someone knows what I'm talking about because this has been driving me crazy. It's not on any of these 'top breakup songs' lists so dont bother looking there. I'm pretty sure I would recognize the name instantly, I just can't put my tongue on it. I hope someone can find it because I am missing it like crazy."

I do love some up and coming bands like grayscale, hot mulligan and stand atlantic but I'm not sure if i can see them even getting to the heights of neck deep.

 The pop-punkers of All Time Low have been relatively quiet in the music scene since 2017’s *Last Young Renegades*, but now, they’re back with a promise of new music and a handful of intimate shows.

Early this morning, the group dropped their new single “Some Kind of Disaster,” along with three tour dates on the East Coast. They’ll play an intimate show at Brighton Music Hall in Boston on January 28, followed by a gig at New York City’s Bowery Ballroom on January 30, and The Ottobar in their hometown of Baltimore on January 31.

“Let’s get REALLY close to each other,” All Time Low said with the announcement, noting that[(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/01/all-time-low-single-east-coast/)"

What other bands are you expecting to release a new album next year?"
3340,1.0,4.749015554945562e-31,"This may have been discussed before, I know for sure the topics have individually.  

I guess I'll get it out of the way that I guess I'm getting old and a lot of the new pop punk bands just don't seem to have the same high energy feel I love.  But some of my favorites especially the older ones from the height of the scene have all been active.

New Releases from: The Wonder Years,  A Day to Remember,  New found glory, and Four Year Strong.  On top of that Simple Plan and NFG announced the ""Pop Punk's Not Dead"" tour.  I'm really hoping to see some tour dates within driving distance with the scene seeming to take off again.  

And getting optimistic here but there's been rumors of Tom Delonge reuniting with Blink 182.  While I'm not too excited about that since Blink hasn't had the same feel in later albums, I'm hoping that frees up Matt for more Alkaline Trio tour dates."

a) pop punk, like any genre, is subjective. I put some stuff on the playlist that I wouldn't necessarily consider pop punk, but is still in the same lane.

b) Most songs have at least SOMEBODY who hasn't heard it, so I know I can't please everyone. (eg. I had a friend who LOVES State Champs and Neck Deep, but didn't know Taking Back Sunday)

Thanks!

 Pop-punk powerhouse All Time Low will headline this year’s second edition of the Sad Summer Festival.

The festival tour, presented by Journeys, will also feature performances from pop-punk’s The Story So Far, indie-rock’s Movements, and alt-rock band The Maine, as well as rising bands in the scene like Yours Truly, Grayscale, and Destroy Boys. Sacramento, California will kick-off the outing on July 17, followed by shows in Dallas, Atlanta, Worcestor, Toronto, and Chicago. Along the way, the fest will stop at outdoor venues like Anaheim’s City National Grove, The Rooftop at Pier 17 in New York City, and Baltimore’s MECU Pavilion before wrapping-up at The Eagles Ballroom in Milwaukee mid-August.

“Rock n Roll summer camp just hits a little bit different when you’re with your friends,” All Time Low frontman Alex Gaskarth said in a statement. “This tour is going to be something special, something[(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/02/all-time-low-sad-summer-festival/)"

ADTR released the single Degenerates last year, and although most fans think this song it's too poppy and FBR made them change their sound, I don't think that's the case. They just released a pop punk song, not an easycore song. 

When All Time Low signed with them, they released Last Young Renegade, which is their poppiest album to date. But when they dropped their lastest single Some Kind of Disaster last month, they went back to their roots with a more pop punk sound. 

So, do you guys think FBR makes bands change their sound to fit the label?"

Ask a NinJam Moderator on how to set up NinJam and join the fantastic jam we produce.

# How is the Latency Calculated in NINJAM?

Latency is calculated musically in terms of BPI (Beats per Interval) and BPM. Although it is not the perfect solution to jam to a cover with complex chord progression changes or endings, it is the perfect solution for any type of form (ABA), # chord progression, and anything with a static chord progression will be perfect for an amazing jam all around the world and take amazing solos.

Take this video for an example of showing you how to jam online, including how NINJAM works:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ5UQhTRVZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ5UQhTRVZU)

I especially love blink-182(Self Titled , Neighbourhoods, Dogs Eating Dogs era best) , I’m huge into Frank Turner , Motion City Soundtrack , No Use For A Name ,Rise Against , Alkaline Trio , Angels And Airwaves , +44, New Found Glory , Sum 41 ,The Ataris , Gaslight Anthem - and recently found The Dangerous Summer ... 

I like melodic , but not kiddie pop punk (Highschool , girls and heartbreak , skateboarding , shows etc ) - I respect that type of pop punk cause that’s literally who I was for 15 years ... I never outgrew pop punk , I just prefer the sounds of musicians who also never grew out of pop punk but grew up with pop punk and still make it but about how they are now.... I don’t know how to explain it ... just more adult pop punk is what I’m looking for 

I’m doing some pretty big art projects in isolation , need something inspirational."

2958,1.0,4.576190397031529e-25,"Total newbie here. I found this sub 2 minutes ago and actually come from a classical music background. But I accidentally found Mmhmm by Relient K and Letters To The President by Hawk Nelson and it changed my life. Newer Hawk Nelson is so different and disappointing. Though I did love Air for Free by Relient K it’s clearly a different vibe.

So I’m looking for some other stuff now. Please don’t hate me for this but I just don’t like tracks with screaming on it, but my faves are California by Hawk Nelson and High of 75 by Relient K. I’m a chronic optimist and definitely not at all someone you’d ever expect to be into pop punk, I like upbeat feel-good vibes, I don’t like tracks that linger in depression. Is there anything else like that, that you’d recommend for someone like me? 

I listen to some ambient stuff like Port Blue, and Windsor Airlift if that helps. So I do like Owl City, usually upbeat vibes which suits my style, and he’s one of the few artists I’ve ever heard that uses orchestral instruments in an original way that doesn’t sound too fake if that makes sense. I guess that’s the classical in me talking again, but whenever he uses strings tracks it sounds authentic to the instrument, different but still good, not like you found your nearest cellist, put a gun to their head so they’d play, and then auto tuned them, which is what most strings in pop music sound like to me."

2492,1.0,0.0,"So a few days ago, I saw an article that was about crafting the ultimate album, based on the original track numbers of the albums they were released on. IE, “Welcome to the Jungle” was Track 1 on “Appetite for Destruction”, is their choice for Track 1 on the Ultimate Album.

I can’t find the article now, but it got me thinking about the success of the March Madness brackets here, and what my ultimate album might look like.

It took me most of the day yesterday going through my iTunes and narrowing it down. It was a lot of fun, but also very difficult. I’ll post the winner of each track, plus a few runners-up, and then you can use your imagination about some of the songs I had to leave on the cutting room floor.

Some notes about methodology – I tried to stick with original songs off of their original albums. No compilations, greatest hits, or covers (unless they’re just that good/well-known). My tastes lean heavily into the mid-90’s to 2010, so most of the songs are from that era and don’t include a lot of the newer bands. A number of the songs bleed into other genres. I am 100% confident that I overthought this, and will continue to overthink it.

To state the obvious: These are personal choices, and this is in no way, shape, or form an objective “best album of all time”. I welcome feedback and questions about my choices, but hope that conversation remains civil (I have no reason to believe otherwise, but sometimes things need to be said). I also wholeheartedly encourage everybody to contribute their own albums.

I’m going to do a countdown with a little commentary starting from the last track, but the TL:DR album is at the bottom.

Hope you enjoy!

Track 14: I originally figured I’d do about 12 songs, or however many I could get with a reasonable number of choices. Managed to get here.

Runners-up (alphabetical order because Excel):

A Day To Remember – “Leave all the Lights On”

New Found Glory – “Who am I?”

Fall Out Boy – “I’ve got all this Ringing in My Ears and None on my Fingers”

You Me at Six – “The Rumour”

Winner: Green Day – “Walking Contradiction”

Tough but not that tough. Not a ton of options, and the longevity takes it here.

Track 13: 

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory – “No News is Good News”

A New Found Glory – “Boulders”

A Skylit Drive – “See You Around”

Finch – “What it is to Burn”

Green Day – “Tightwad Hill”

Winner: Less Than Jake – “Last Hour of the Last Day”

A number of decent options, this one just felt right.

Track 12:

Honorable Mention: Four Letter Lie – “Rocky Loves Emily” (because 3 Ninjas rules!)

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory – “The Story So Far”

A New Found Glory – “Don’t Let This Be the End”

Hit The Lights – “Make a Run for It”

Silverstein – “Rain Will Fall”

Yellowcard – “Cut Me, Mick”

Winner:

Simple Plan – “Perfect”

This was surprisingly difficult for the tail end of the album. I guess the adage “save the best for last” applies here. Starting to notice a theme – I freaking love NFG.

Track 11:

Runners-up:

Bayside – “Guardrail”

Emery – “Edge of the World”

Fall Out Boy – “Bang the Doldrums”

Green Day – “Wake Me Up When September Ends”

Hawthorne Heights – “Speeding Up the Octaves”

Rise Against – “Savior”

Winner:

Silverstein – “Call it Karma”

One of my favorite all time songs, it wasn’t that hard to pick the winner. Good selection of runners-up, though. Had to leave some good ones off the list.

Track 10:

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory – “Heartless at Best”

Coheed and Cambria – “A Favor House Atlantic”

Fall Out Boy – “I Slept with Someone in Fall Out Boy and All I Got Was This Stupid Song”

Panic! At The Disco – “I Write Sins, Not Tragedies”

Silverstein – “Love With Caution”

Winner(s):

Green Day – “When I Come Around”

Thrice – “The Artist In The Ambulance”

Had trouble choosing and copped out. If I had to choose one, I’d probably go with Thrice and bump PATD or Coheed off the list. 

Track 9:

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory – “Persistent” 

Brand New – “Guernica” 

Less Than Jake – “Mostly Memories”

Taking Back Sunday – “You’re So Last Summer”

Underoath – “Writing on the Walls” 

Winner:

Coheed and Cambria – “The Suffering”

Track 8

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory – “Barbed Wire”

Anberlin – “The Feel Good Drag”

Hawthorne Heights – “Ohio is for Lovers”

Paramore – “Crushcrushcrush”

You Me At Six – “You’ve Made Your Bed (So Sleep In It)”

Winner:

Rise Against – “Audience of One”

Another one of my favorite all time songs, with some tough second place finishers and brutal cuts before that. ADTR, Blink 182, Bayside, and The Almost just to name a few.

Track 7:

Runners-up:

Coheed and Cambria – “Gravemakers &amp; Gunslingers”

Emarosa – “Set it Off Like Napalm”

Emery – “The Weakest”

Green Day – “Basket Case”

Less Than Jake – “History of a Boring Town”

Story Of The Year – “Nothing Can Fly”

Winner:

Silverstein – “My Heroine”

I almost put Green Day as a co-winner again, but that seemed disingenuous. More tough cuts to get to this list. More NFG, Blink, FOB, Bayside, and Thrice.

Track 6:

Runners-up:

All Time Low – “Dear Maria, Count Me In”

Bayside – “Choice Hops and Bottled Self Esteem”

My Chemical Romance – “The Ghost of You”

Rise Against – “Prayer of the Refugee”

Silverstein – “Still Dreaming”

Winner:

The Used – “Buried Myself Alive”

No contest on the winner for me. ADTR, Something Corporate, Underoath, and Yellowcard among the cuts.

Track 5:

Honorable Mention: Avenged Sevenfold – “Gunslinger” – not really Pop-Punk, Emo, or Post-Hardcore, but it’s a great song.

Runners-up:

A New Found Glory – “Ready and Willing II”

A New Found Glory – “Head on Collision”

Anberlin – “A Day Late”

Dashboard Confessional – “Rooftops and Invitations”

Green Day – “Welcome to Paradise”

Hawthorne Heights – “Saying Sorry”

My Chemical Romance – “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)”

My Chemical Romance – “Welcome to the Black Parade”

Thrice – “Stare at the Sun”

Winner:

Brand New – “The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows”

WTF. I continued to cut as I’m writing this post, and I still have that many left. Some of those are top 20 all time songs. I had to leave “Calling All Cars” (Senses Fail) and “Southern Weather” (The Almost) off. TWO FOB songs (“Hum Hallelujah” and “Nobody Puts Baby in the Corner”). Wow.

Track 4:

Runners-up:

A Day To Remember – “The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle”

A New Found Glory – “Truth of My Youth”

A New Found Glory – “Hit or Miss”

Dashboard Confessional – “Stolen”

Emery – “Studying Politics”

Fall Out Boy – “Sugar, We’re Going Down”

Less Than Jake – “The Science of Selling Yourself Short”

Paramore – “Misery Business”

Senses Fail – “Family Tradition”

Sum 41 – “Still Waiting”

The Starting Line – “The Best of Me”

Yellowcard – “Sure Thing Falling”

Winner:

Senses Fail – “Can’t Be Saved”

Cut while writing this: Green Day – “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” (with 3 others not making it this far), Red Jumpsuit Apparatus – “Face Down”, Fall Out Boy – “Saturday”, Sum 41 – “Fat Lip”, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones – “The Impression That I Get”.

This is getting tough.

Track 3:

Runners-up

A Day To Remember – “I’m Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?”

A New Found Glory – “Listen to Your Friends”

Bayside – “Duality”

Blink 182 – “Dammit”

Coheed and Cambria – “Welcome Home”

Dashboard Confessional – “The Best Deceptions”

Fall Out Boy – “Dance, Dance”

Fall Out Boy – “This Ain’t a Scene, It’s an Arms Race”

Less Than Jake – “Look What Happened”

Taking Back Sunday – “MakeDamnSure”

The Fray – “How to Save a Life”

Thrice – “All That’s Left”

Yellowcard – “Ocean Avenue”

Winner:

Coheed and Cambria – “Welcome Home”

Hard choice here. Ultimately had to go with the epic feel of it, but I’m not solid on it. Any of these could do the job. So many songs cut here.

Track 2:

Runners-up:

A Day to Remember – “Right Back At It Again”

A New Found Glory – “Resurrection”

A New Found Glory – “My Friends Over You”

A New Found Glory – “Party On Apocalypse”

A New Found Glory – “Don’t Let Her Pull You Down”

AFI – “The Leaving Song Pt. II”

Anberlin – “Paperthin Hymn”

Armor For Sleep – “The Truth About Heaven”

Less Than Jake – “The Ghosts of Me and You”

Paramore – “That’s What You Get”

Silverstein – “Smile In Your Sleep”

Story Of The Year – “Until the Day I Die”

Taking Back Sunday – “Sink Into Me”

The Forecast – “And We All Return to Our Roots”

The Fray – “Over My Head (Cable Car)”

The Used – “I Caught Fire (In Your Eyes)”

The Used – “The Taste of Ink”

Winner:

A Day to Remember – “All I Want”

I categorically refuse to make any last minute cuts here. I can’t. So many good options. Any of these could sub in, depending on where I wanted the album to go. I suppose that holds true for any of top picks.

Track 1:

A New Found Glory – “Selfless”

A New Found Glory – “Right Where We Left Off”

Bayside – “Masterpiece”

Blink 182 – “Feeling This”

Dashboard Confessional – “Don’t Wait”

Emery – “Walls”

Fall Out Boy – “Thriller”

Green Day – “American Idiot”

Green Day – “Nice Guys Finish Last”

Silverstein – “Smashed into Pieces”

Simple Plan – “I’d Do Anything”

Winner:

Emarosa – “The Past Should Stay Dead”

Gotta kick it in the teeth to start. That’s my justification and I’m sticking to it. Otherwise, I’ll be starting all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Full album:

13) Less Than Jake – “Last Hour of the Last Day”

Final thoughts:

I’m really happy with this album. I think there’s a really good flow to it. Kick it off strong, then go up and down the whole time.

There…is clearly a story being told by my choices, though. Now time for some deep introspection!"
